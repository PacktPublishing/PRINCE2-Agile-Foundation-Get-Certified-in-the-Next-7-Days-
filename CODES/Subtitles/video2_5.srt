1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,810
- So in this lesson, we're going to talk

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,350
about management products.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,006
In the PRINCE2 method,
there are 26 distinct

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,510
management products that are created

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,990
throughout the lifecycle

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,660
and throughout the project.

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,750
All of these can be found in appendix A

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,260
of your PRINCE2 manual or
your PRINCE2 Agile manual.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,690
Now, you don't need to know
all 26 of them for the exam.

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,030
But there are several of them that

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,279
you have to be familiar with,

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,112
because they are heavily tailored

13
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,700
and used inside of an Agile environment.

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,600
This includes your business case,

15
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,350
your checkpoint report,
your highlight report,

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,840
your project brief, your project
initiation documentation,

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,350
your project product description,

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,796
and your work package.

19
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:40,629
And so we're going to
talk about each of those

20
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:42,550
inside of this lesson.

21
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,540
The first management product
we're going to talk about

22
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,940
is the business case.

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,480
And the business case is used to

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,667
document the justification for starting

25
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:52,490
and continuing this project.

26
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,310
The business case is
going to be referenced

27
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,770
over and over again during the project,

28
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,860
to ensure there is still a continued

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,150
business justification that exists.

30
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,560
As we look in the business case,

31
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,980
it's going to tell us things like

32
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,270
what we hope to achieve with this project.

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,400
If this project was to build a website

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,260
and what is the goal of
building that website?

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,010
Is it to sell more widgets?

36
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,670
Or is it to inform people?

37
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it to get better brand awareness?

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,380
Whatever that purpose is,
it should be documented

39
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,010
inside the business case.

40
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,540
It should say, we're going to spend,

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,300
roughly, x amount of dollars
to get y amount of value.

42
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,540
That's what it's all about.

43
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,000
It's what are the benefits and
the outcomes of this project?

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,520
And that way we can keep going back

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
to that business case to see if we're

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,300
still on track to hit those.

47
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,330
And if we're not, then we might

48
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,900
be terminating this project early

49
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,040
using closing a project process.

50
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,350
The next management product we're going to

51
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,300
talk about is the checkpoint report.

52
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,490
And your checkpoint report is a report

53
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,160
that the team manager's going to create

54
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,240
and send up to the project manager

55
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,090
with a current status
of their work packages.

56
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,560
So whatever they're working on,

57
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,130
to be able to build their product,

58
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,450
they need to be able to report that

59
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,800
up to the project manager.

60
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,360
Because, again, we want
to manage by exception.

61
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,810
Both from the project board
down to the project manager

62
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,910
and from the project manager
down to the team manager.

63
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,550
So this team manager is going to be able

64
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,500
to use this time based control,

65
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
where every week or every month

66
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,230
they send a report up
to the project manager

67
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,917
to say, "Here's where we are.

68
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,247
"Here's the progress we made.

69
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,867
"Here's the issues we have

70
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,190
"and here's the status of my pieces."

71
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,990
Now, just like we have
this Checkpoint Report

72
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,540
going up to the project manager,

73
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,180
the project manager gets multiple

74
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,820
Checkpoint Reports from
all of the different teams.

75
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,360
They're going to consolidate all of those

76
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,233
and create a single report
called a Highlight Report.

77
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,066
And the Highlight Report is going to go

78
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,950
from the project manager all the way

79
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,480
up to the project board.

80
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,020
And this is going to give them the current

81
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,170
status of the stage plan.

82
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,030
So all the different moving
pieces, for this stage,

83
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,840
are going to be incorporated
into this single report,

84
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,080
based off of those Checkpoint Reports.

85
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,210
Again, this is a time based control.

86
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,020
And based on how your project is set up,

87
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,210
it may be weekly, every two weeks,

88
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,260
every month, every six months,

89
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,970
it really depends on how
risky your project is

90
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,410
and how much control the project board

91
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,810
wants to retain and how much they

92
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,090
want to delegate down
to that project manager.

93
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,460
The next one we're going to talk about

94
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,190
is your project brief.

95
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,870
Now the project brief is what's going to

96
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,310
be created in the starting
up a project phase

97
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,110
and it's going to be used to get approval

98
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,410
to move into your
initiating a project phase,

99
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,290
where we'll actually develop a really good

100
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,920
and thought out business case.

101
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,420
But the project brief is created

102
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,490
even before that initial business case.

103
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,980
It's kind of like the outline.

104
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,140
The next document we have is the project

105
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,450
initiation document or the PIT.

106
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,290
This is the cornerstone of any project.

107
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,260
It's going to describe
the plan of approach

108
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,670
for project management
throughout the project.

109
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,660
It's going to contain lots of different

110
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,450
pieces underneath it,
including the project plan,

111
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,010
the detailed business
case, the communications

112
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,550
management approach, the
risk management approach,

113
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,210
the quality management approach,

114
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,060
the change control approach,
the project controls,

115
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,360
and any tailoring that
you're going to perform.

116
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,010
This is the golden document
inside of a project.

117
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,690
And it is created all the way back

118
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,230
in your initiating a project phase.

119
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,910
When you're initiating a project,

120
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,730
you're creating that
project initiation document.

121
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,660
And once it's approved, that's when

122
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,760
you're able to move into your first stage.

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,400
Now the next one we're going to talk about

124
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,900
is your project product description.

125
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,285
As we're going to figure out
what we're going to build,

126
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,630
we're going to have to be able to exactly

127
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,430
describe what is going to be delivered.

128
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,070
So if I'm going to build a house,

129
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,070
I should know, right from the beginning,

130
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,120
how many bedrooms?

131
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,440
How many bathrooms?

132
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,060
Is it going to have a kitchen or not?

133
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,380
Is it going to have a garage?

134
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,660
Is it going to have storage?

135
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,880
All of these things would have to be told

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,110
inside this project description.

137
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,920
It's going to tell us
exactly what we want.

138
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,340
Is it going to be built out of cement,

139
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,530
or brick, or wood, right?

140
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,760
And inside of this project
product description,

141
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,960
we're going to contain
things like the purpose,

142
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,350
the composition, the specifications,

143
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,890
the quality controls,
the tolerance levels,

144
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,810
and the acceptance criteria.

145
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,890
All of these will define
what the end result

146
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,990
of this project is going to be, based on

147
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,950
that product description.

148
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,720
The next one we have is our work package.

149
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,743
And this is what our team
manager's going to use

150
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:13,600
to create that product and
do product delivery for us.

151
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,430
The team manager uses the work package

152
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,460
which has his tolerances set in it

153
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,500
and what the acceptance criteria is,

154
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,540
to build out that product.

155
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,640
So if I'm going to this house example,

156
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,010
maybe I have a work
package for the plumbing.

157
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,340
And I have a work package for the floors.

158
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,300
And a work package for the electrical.

159
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,070
And each of those three team managers

160
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,220
now knows, inside that work package,

161
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,950
how many electrical outlets I need,

162
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,960
how many toilets I need,
how many sinks I need,

163
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,100
how many types of flooring I need.

164
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,920
All of those details are
in those work packages.

165
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,760
Each of those work
packages would be approved

166
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,040
by the project manager, prior to any work

167
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,860
beginning on that work package.

168
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,420
And allows that project manager

169
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,780
to have levels of control established

170
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,850
and then allow the team
manager to be empowered,

171
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,663
to get that final product created.
