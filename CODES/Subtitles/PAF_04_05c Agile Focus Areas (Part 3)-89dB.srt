1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:02,475
- The next Agile focus area is called

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:04,658
The Information Radiator
or the Team Board.

3
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:07,815
This is something that is
placed in your team's workspace

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,569
that allows you to visualize everything

5
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:12,041
that's being worked on.

6
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,675
So you can see here, we have the goal.

7
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,613
We're going to define
that the project is going

8
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:18,187
to be done by the end of the year.

9
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:19,523
Underneath that, you can see we have the

10
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:21,464
Kanban chart, showing
what is to be worked on

11
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:25,311
what's in progress, and what
is ready to be pushed out.

12
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:27,159
We can also see our team rules.

13
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,777
What are the things that our
team is going to buy into?

14
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,605
In this case: We should all be honest,

15
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,908
we should all be open
and everyone has a say.

16
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,978
So, really valuing that collaboration.

17
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:38,645
Then we go up on the other side.

18
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,674
We have our effort versus
time graph, which is

19
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,247
known as a burn down chart.

20
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,340
You could see the amount of
work that needs to be done

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,863
and the amount of time we have left.

22
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:48,404
And then, in the bottom corner,
we have issues and news.

23
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:50,561
And this is going to
be a way to tell people

24
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,970
new things about the
team, and what's happening

25
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,064
in the world around us and
things we have to consider

26
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,962
and the issues are things
we have problems with.

27
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,076
And those are issues
that we're bringing up

28
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:02,450
to the project manager
and the team manager

29
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,609
so they can help us deal with those issues

30
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:07,427
and make sure that we stay
on time and on budget.

31
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:10,619
Again, this is a great way
of visualizing information

32
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,955
and showing everybody what's going on.

33
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,144
Being open, being transparent and enabling

34
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:18,293
that rich communication
as we move forward.

35
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:21,777
Frequent releases are another
key concept inside of Agile.

36
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,649
With frequent releases, we're
really focused on releasing

37
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,022
something quickly that is
usable to the end customer.

38
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,703
This is going to be something
like a prototype or a beta

39
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,788
or it could be our finalized product.

40
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,495
Either way, it's going to
require a lot of planning

41
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,393
on our part, and we do this
using product-based planning

42
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:40,330
where we start with the end in mind.

43
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,232
What is this product we're trying to build

44
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,479
breaking it down into its component pieces

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,289
and putting it together.

46
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,572
There's a lot of advantages
to doing frequent releases.

47
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:50,929
The first is that you get early delivery

48
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,523
of benefits to your customer.

49
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,350
The customer gets something they can start

50
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,991
working with, and as they
start working with it,

51
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,969
they start going "Oh,
this isn't working the

52
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,852
"way I thought it was going to work".

53
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,391
And they give you
feedback, that allows you

54
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,871
to iterate for the next cycle.

55
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,843
This helps reduce the risk of
delivering the wrong product.

56
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,000
If I was going to build the entire product

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,417
from start to finish,
it may take me a year.

58
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,547
But if I can give them
something to look at,

59
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:14,676
maybe a wire frame diagram
of the app we're building

60
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,262
or may be able to give them a
couple of features to try out,

61
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,857
we could start to figure
out are we on the right path

62
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,506
to getting the final product?

63
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,000
Or, do we need to change
and adjust where we are?

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,868
This also gives us confidence

65
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,485
in how the project is progressing.

66
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,092
Because, if the customer keeps going

67
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:30,841
"Yes, this is good", "Yes, this is good"

68
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,344
"Yes, this is good" as we go along these

69
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,696
iterations, it really
does help the team know

70
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,446
they're on the right path.

71
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:40,655
This also is going to foster
better stakeholder engagement.

72
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,465
Because, the customer is
something they can touch

73
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,672
it's something they can
use and see if it's working

74
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,087
the way they wanted it to.

75
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:48,132
And, the final thing,
is it makes releasing

76
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,138
products easier. It
doesn't have to be this

77
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,812
big, huge deal where we release a product.

78
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:54,187
Because if we release
something, and it's not

79
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:57,077
quite right, we can go
back and iterate it again.

80
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,008
Whereas, if you use a waterfall approach,

81
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,460
it may have taken you a
year or two years to get

82
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,952
to this final product release.

83
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,854
And then, if you went
and hit the wrong thing,

84
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:07,938
that is going to be
devastating to your team.

85
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,948
So, frequent releases really are helpful

86
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,492
in the Agile way of working.

87
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,774
The next focus area we
have is Retrospectives.

88
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:17,067
And, retrospectives are a technique

89
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,997
that we use at the end of a sprint.

90
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,065
This is a technique
when we're working in an

91
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:24,096
agile way where we review
the ways the processes

92
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:26,285
that we use to get the product done.

93
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,946
This is something that we
have to plan and structure.

94
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,277
And it's going to cover
what went wrong and what

95
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,660
didn't go well.

96
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,593
Was there good communication involved?

97
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,601
Was there good collaboration?

98
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,545
What is working and what isn't?

99
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,491
We're going to improve little by little,

100
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:43,027
continuously, early, and often.

101
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,710
Because this is going
to help us get better

102
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,304
in the next sprint,
and in the next sprint,

103
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,128
and then the next sprint.

104
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,821
We also want to make sure
that the retrospectives

105
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:52,103
are efficient, and
effective, and to do this,

106
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,901
we might introduce variety.

107
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,733
Maybe, sometimes, we're going to do them

108
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,685
as a workshop. Maybe sometimes we're going

109
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,880
to do them as a lunch meeting.

110
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,965
Whatever it is, we want
to kind of break it up

111
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,023
a little bit so it is
not just so monotonous.

112
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:06,256
But, this is a great
way to gather feedback

113
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:10,923
in the forms of facts or feelings
of what you felt went well

114
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,118
Or, what actually went well.

115
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,030
Or, what you felt wasn't good.

116
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,832
Or, what really didn't go well.

117
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,860
And, by being table to
take all this information

118
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,724
we can learn from that experience

119
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,863
and improve ourself as we move forward.

120
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,567
Retrospectives are really key
to that continual improvement

121
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,989
as we move forward throughout

122
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:30,190
the processes, working in an agile way.

123
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,527
And, one of the ways we do that

124
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,937
is by workshops, I said, right?

125
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:35,452
Well, workshops are run as a way for us

126
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,118
to gather the information.

127
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:40,327
It uses live, face to
face interaction workshop

128
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,643
as a way to gather these lessons learned.

129
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:46,089
A workshop is run usually
by a neutral facilitator,

130
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,308
who can manage the workshop and make sure

131
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,535
the process is being done properly.

132
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,094
It is going to allow to get

133
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,761
these interactions and creativity.

134
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,517
We can use this for a retrospective.

135
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,134
But, we can also use this
for the prioritization

136
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:00,889
in creating all the
requirements for the product.

137
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,441
Workshops can be used at
any point during a project.

138
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,649
And, they're really useful
both at the beginning

139
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,738
of the project, with the
requirements gathering,

140
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,599
but also at the end of each sprint,

141
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,709
using them for retrospectives.

142
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,232
Now, this can help us get
quality outputs quickly,

143
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,579
if you conduct the proper preparation.

144
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,412
And, there are a couple
key areas you want to think

145
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:22,513
about, when preparing for this workshop.

146
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,453
You want to make sure that you've defined

147
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,314
what the objective of the workshop is.

148
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,848
Are we doing this workshop
to gather requirements?

149
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:30,979
Or, are we doing it as a retrospective?

150
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,583
We also need to figure out
who needs to be in attendance.

151
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,434
If we're going to be
gathering requirements,

152
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,743
that is going to be people
like your suppliers.

153
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,704
That is going to be
people like your customer,

154
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,072
your development team, your team manager,

155
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,592
and your project manager.

156
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,290
But, if we're going to do a retrospective,

157
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,332
we may have to bring in
other people, or less people.

158
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,922
And, so we have to think about that.

159
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,657
Logistics. You need to think about

160
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,459
where you're going to hold this workshop.

161
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,245
Is it going to be done
in a conference room?

162
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,787
Is it going to be done in a break room?

163
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,840
Is it going to be done
virtually, over technology?

164
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,937
You have to think about all of that.

165
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,436
And then, finally, pre-reading.

166
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,334
When you're preparing for this workshop,

167
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,707
not only are you preparing
to hold the workshop,

168
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,442
but the people who are coming
should be prepared, as well.

169
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,782
So, if we're going to go through
and we're going to develop

170
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,603
the idea for our next big product

171
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,677
as part of our requirements gathering,

172
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:18,673
and we're going to build a new iPhone app,

173
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:20,339
then we probably should
have some pre-reading

174
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,210
so people can understand
what's been popular

175
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,082
in the market space so far.

176
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,491
What are some of the ideas
we're already thinking about?

177
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,837
And, they can start
getting their minds ready

178
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:31,254
and in that mindset of
what we're going to do

179
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,859
when we have this workshop.

180
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,107
Now, when we do workshops, I've found

181
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,296
that there are three
great ways to hold these.

182
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,001
One is you want to make sure

183
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,234
you have lots of whiteboards there.

184
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,416
Because, you could write
up ideas really quickly,

185
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,866
you can erase them if they're bad,

186
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,885
and you can keep moving on.

187
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,311
Workshops should also
be group-working focus.

188
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,800
Everyone should be involved.

189
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,890
It shouldn't be one person
running the whole show

190
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,499
and answering all of the questions.

191
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,132
You want to get everybody involved in it,

192
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,219
because the best ideas come
from that collaboration

193
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,528
when we're working in an agile way.

194
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,465
And the other thing I
find works really well

195
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,493
is sticky notes, especially when you are

196
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,931
doing your requirements gathering.

197
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,332
Because, you can write it
down really quickly on a note

198
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,259
and stick it up on that whiteboard

199
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,936
and move them around very quickly.

200
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,797
And then, at the end, snap a picture of it

201
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,599
and you've got your work board

202
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,871
that you can start working from.

203
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,490
So this is just some of
the ideas that you have,

204
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,339
when you start working
through these workshops.

205
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,862
And, the more you practice them,

206
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:21,241
the better you're going to get.
