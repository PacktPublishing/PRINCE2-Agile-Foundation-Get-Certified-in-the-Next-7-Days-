1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,350
- In the last lesson we talked about

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,500
the six performance variables.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Time, cost, risk, benefit,
scope and quality.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,710
Now, you may be wondering we we're able to

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,920
flex some and fix some.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,410
And it really comes
down to the five targets

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,440
which represent the reasoning why

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,490
we have these six areas
and why we're going to

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,590
find or fix certain ones.

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,360
These five targets all come down to

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,660
being on time and hitting deadlines,

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,480
protecting the level of quality,

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,570
embracing change, keeping your team stable

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,710
and accepting that the customer
doesn't need everything.

15
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,110
We're going to talk about
each of those in this lesson.

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,610
The first one is being on time
and hitting your deadlines.

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,990
We talked about the
fact that time was fixed

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,430
in an Agile project.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,870
The reason is, we need to
get a product out there

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,570
to get that early realization of benefits.

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,760
This is going to help us
with further planning,

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,340
giving us confidence that
we can deliver things

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,630
and sometimes we just have no choice

24
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,660
but to deliver on time.

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,090
By doing all of this and
hitting our deadlines

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,210
it really does reduce our likelihood

27
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,860
of having cost over runs,
and it's going to help us

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,850
to improve our reputation.

29
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,540
Because if we hit our deadlines

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,230
the customer starts realizing

31
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,900
that when you say you're
going to get something

32
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,260
out on time, they can
take that to the bank.

33
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,130
They know you're going to deliver.

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,900
Now, you many not deliver with everything

35
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,500
they wanted, but you're
going to give them something.

36
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,860
And that's the key here.

37
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,390
We want to build this trust between

38
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,580
the customer and the
supplier relationship,

39
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,550
and being on time and
hitting those deadlines

40
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,350
is critical to that.

41
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,114
The next one we have when
we talk about the five

42
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:36,390
targets is embracing change.

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,450
Because change is inevitable.

44
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,840
You're going to hit
roadblocks inside your project

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,440
and you're going to
have to move around them

46
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,850
and change things up to get to something

47
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,150
that's deliverable.

48
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,510
The more accurate your final product is,

49
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,060
is going to be based on how much change

50
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,500
and how quickly you can
adapt to that change

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,530
based on what your seeing.

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,260
In Agile we are very, very focused

53
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,770
on embracing change.

54
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,600
Because we know that we have the ability

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
to flex with intolerances, to get to what

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,810
needs to be delivered.

57
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,560
A lot of times you'll have a customer

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
who asks for something,
and they don't really

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,580
define the requirement well.

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,830
And so when you start building it

61
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,270
you realize, you know they asked for X

62
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,100
but they really need Y.

63
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,040
By embracing change you have the ability

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
to flex what is being delivered

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,640
and deliver Y instead
of X and the customer

66
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,050
will usually be happier for it.

67
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,680
The third target we're going to talk about

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,240
is protecting the level of quality.

69
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,980
This is important because it ensures

70
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,300
that you have the appropriate level

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,943
of quality being achieved in order

72
00:02:34,943 --> 00:02:37,780
for you to get the desired
outcomes and benefits

73
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,330
that you were expecting.

74
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,880
A lot of times poor quality can happen

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,110
if you start reducing your testing cycle,

76
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,790
if you don't bother to
do any documentation,

77
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,250
if you create a sub optimal design.

78
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,970
Sometimes it happens because you don't

79
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,530
give good training to your end user

80
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,950
and they don't understand how to use

81
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,370
the product you delivered.

82
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,330
And sometimes you just decide

83
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,100
you're not going to
comply with any standards

84
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,960
in the marketplace and
you design something

85
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,793
on your own.

86
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,070
And when you don't comply with standards

87
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,850
that's going to decrease your
level of quality as well.

88
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,890
Now, to protect the level of quality

89
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,010
that's where this fix and flex comes in.

90
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,770
Again, we're going to fix those required

91
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,730
and essential items but we're going

92
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,160
to flex the requirements
for those that are desired.

93
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,000
And the reason is that by flexing

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,640
on the desired things we can free up

95
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,700
more time and resources to focus

96
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,060
on those required or essential things,

97
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,460
improving the quality there which is

98
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,180
going to have more impact
to our final project.

99
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,810
Our fourth target that
we're going to look at

100
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,340
is keeping our teams stable.

101
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,370
Agile uses this concept
of self organizing teams

102
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,080
and informal communication.

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,830
And because of that you
have to have this team

104
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,280
trust that gets built.

105
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,130
There's this norming and forming stage

106
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,650
that happens and eventually the team

107
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,490
starts working together well.

108
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,420
Well if you start getting
behind on a project

109
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,870
and you go, you know
what, let's just throw in

110
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,830
another person into that team,

111
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,350
that'll give us additional people,

112
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,260
we can get more work done, it usually

113
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,300
will actually have a detrimental effect.

114
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,260
Because when we bring in a new team member

115
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,210
we have to spend time
getting them up to speed

116
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,440
of where we are.

117
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,170
We also have to start
increasing the number

118
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,430
of communication lines.

119
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,470
So now instead of having
fie people to communicate

120
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,700
on our team, we have six or seven.

121
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,420
And that takes more time
and as we start growing

122
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,280
that becomes harder to deal with.

123
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,090
Teams should be kept small as they work

124
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,350
on a project.

125
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,520
There's opportunity
costs that also incurred

126
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,960
because if I start looking at Jason's team

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,650
over here is behind schedule and we're

128
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,400
going to take somebody from Ally's team

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,920
and bring them over, well now Ally's team

130
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,270
is one person down.

131
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,230
And there's opportunity
cost that's incurred

132
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,215
by taking that person
away from Ally's team

133
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:39,730
because they're not able to do what

134
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,070
they need to do now.

135
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,900
And the other thing is,
when I bring in new people

136
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,590
the team dynamics change.

137
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,710
And when you change those team dynamics

138
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,450
everything has to be re-established

139
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,500
because there may be
trust with the five people

140
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,090
on the current team, but when you bring in

141
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,410
person number six,
nobody knows that person.

142
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,480
Nobody trusts them, they're still feeling

143
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,650
them out and figuring out if they

144
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,610
can trust that person
and if they understand

145
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,050
and respect their opinion.

146
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,940
So, what we look at with Agile,

147
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,830
is keeping your team stable.

148
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
On the exam, if you get asked a question

149
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,250
about this, the appropriate time

150
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,320
to add or remove people from the team

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,210
is at the end of a sprint.

152
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,390
Get through your entire month long sprint

153
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,040
and then you can change out the teams

154
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,170
and start again.

155
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,180
That's okay.

156
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,192
But if you're behind schedule

157
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,050
the idea that you can throw more

158
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,280
people at the problem is
not going to save you,

159
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,210
it's going to actually
cause you more problems

160
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,010
and get you further behind.

161
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,440
Now the final target we have is

162
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,500
accepting the fact that the customer

163
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,310
doesn't need everything.

164
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,980
This is a really true statement

165
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,350
because customers will tell you

166
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,910
all of the things that they need

167
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,950
and if you're asking them about a car

168
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,240
they want you to build and you start

169
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
getting all the requirements you may

170
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,660
get some silly things in there,

171
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,320
like I want a car that can fly,

172
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,260
I want a car that can drive itself,

173
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,140
I want a car that can
go zero to 3,000 miles

174
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,700
on one tank of fuel.

175
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,270
Those are all great things and hopefully

176
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,613
we can get there one day but today

177
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:57,250
the technology doesn't
exist for all of those.

178
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,490
And so you have to start prioritizing

179
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,130
the features of the product that are

180
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,270
the safest and most sensible area

181
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,870
that you want to be able to get done

182
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,907
and then the things that
you can compromise on,

183
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,970
you want to compromise on.

184
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,600
You want to realize that not everything

185
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
defined at the start of the project

186
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,730
has to be delivered as a final output.

187
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,851
And this is very different
then our traditional

188
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,510
waterfall development.

189
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,600
In Agile we understand that we may have

190
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,150
100 requirements and we're only going to

191
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,650
deliver 10 of those.

192
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,100
Many of the functions and features

193
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,110
are never even used in the final product.

194
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,120
And so it's okay to remove those.

195
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,930
Let's think about Microsoft PowerPoint

196
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,330
or Microsoft Word.

197
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,170
How many functions do you actually use

198
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,600
in one of those programs.

199
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,300
Most people probably use about 10 or 15.

200
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,760
You might use some things like

201
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,280
changing the font color or the font size

202
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,820
or centering it versus left justifying it.

203
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,570
But those programs have thousands

204
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,650
of different features.

205
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,160
And if I took away half of the features

206
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,430
in that program, you probably wouldn't

207
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,010
even know as a customer.

208
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,520
And so removing features can help you

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,930
to meet the deadlines you need

210
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,530
and protect the level of quality

211
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,880
for those essential items.

212
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,540
So again going back to my Microsoft Word

213
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,773
example, things like changing font sizes

214
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,080
and changing font colors and be able to

215
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,410
left justify or center.

216
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,660
Those are essential things
that people use everyday,

217
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,520
we want to make sure those are protected.

218
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,690
But if there's something
like the mail merge function

219
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,300
that maybe one out of 1,000
customers are going to use,

220
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,410
we can sacrifice on the
level of quality there

221
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,650
if needed.

222
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,010
And we also want to make sure

223
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,850
that we're delivering what the customer

224
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,670
really wants and what
they really need quickly.

225
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,590
And by removing all
these additional features

226
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,050
that may take us months or years to get to

227
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,690
we can give them a product today

228
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,260
that does 90% of everything they need

229
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,740
which is going to make them happier

230
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,530
to have something in
their hand they can use

231
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,860
as opposed to something on the shelf

232
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,560
that you're still developing.

233
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
Now when we look at all of this

234
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,590
these are those five targets and

235
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,720
these are the reasoning of why we fix

236
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,120
and why we flex on different requirements

237
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,793
inside Agile development.
