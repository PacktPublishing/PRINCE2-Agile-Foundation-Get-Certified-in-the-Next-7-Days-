1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,620
- What is project management?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,410
After all PRINCE2 Agile
is focused on being

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,390
a project management framework.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,450
Well, project management is the practice

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,750
of initiating, planning,
executing, controlling

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,060
and closing the work of a team to achieve

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,120
specific goals and meet
specific success criteria

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,810
at a specific time.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,400
But we have to understand
what is a project.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,200
Well a project is a temporary organization

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,890
that's created for the
purpose of delivering

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,710
one or more business products,

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,660
according to an agreed upon business case.

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,550
Now the key with a project
is that it is temporary.

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,780
It is for a short duration of time.

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,070
Now what exactly is a
short duration of time?

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,220
Well, a project may be a couple of months,

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,180
or it may be a couple
of years, but we're not

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,610
going to do a single
project and keep it going

20
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,780
for 20 or 30 years, that wouldn't be

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,910
a very temporary organization.

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,220
Now what kind of things
do we do with a project?

23
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,170
Well, we may be building a new building,

24
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,540
so if we're going to build
a skyscraper for example,

25
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,097
we have to plan exactly
when each part of that

26
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:02,110
I'm going to happen, that
includes building the foundation,

27
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,960
getting the work crews
on so that we can build

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,680
up the structure, and then we have to put

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,510
on the outside of the
building with the glass,

30
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,070
and the ceiling, and
then we're going to have

31
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,230
to go inside building and
start doing all the wiring

32
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,030
and the plumbing, there's a
lot of moving pieces here.

33
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,780
And so project management helps us manage

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,940
the output of this project
to make sure things are done

35
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,380
in the proper sequence,
in the proper order,

36
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,150
and to the proper cost.

37
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,820
On the other hand, if
we're going to do something

38
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,710
that's very normal and routine,

39
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,090
we call that business as usual.

40
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,910
Business as usual is defined
as work that is conducted

41
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,330
by an organization on a daily basis.

42
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,180
So if you work in IT for example,

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,260
and you need to setup a new user account,

44
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,930
you wouldn't need a project for that.

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,370
Instead, that's a simple
thing that you're going to do.

46
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,830
You'll get the person's
name, you'll create an email,

47
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,310
and you'll setup their account.

48
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,670
If we want to build a
whole new service for IT,

49
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,480
maybe we're going to
migrate all of our servers

50
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,210
from Windows into Linux,
that would be a project,

51
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,130
because it's bigger, it's more complex,

52
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,250
and it's more difficult.

53
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,970
And so that's what we're
going to do, is figure

54
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,720
out what is a project and
what is business as usual.

55
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,790
One of the key differences
between projects

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,100
and business as usual is what frameworks

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,470
you can use for them.

58
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,850
Agile can be used for both
projects and business as usual.

59
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,510
But PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile

60
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,810
are designed specifically for projects.

61
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,250
If we're doing something
that's going to be considered

62
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,070
business as usual, you
can use Agile techniques,

63
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,640
but, you won't be using PRINCE2 Agile,

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,470
so any time we're going
to do a project we have

65
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,710
to decide are we're going to use PRINCE2

66
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,610
or are we going to use PRINCE2 Agile?

67
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,840
If it is something that
needs to be developed

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,900
in an Agile method,
then we're going to lean

69
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,270
towards PRINCE2 Agile.

70
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,300
If it's something that needs
really tight governance

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,260
and control structures,
that's when we're going to

72
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,284
lean more towards PRINCE2.

73
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:39,110
So in this course we
are going to be focused

74
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,580
on projects, not business as usual,

75
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,820
and so when we think
about a project remember,

76
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,480
it is something that is temporary.

77
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,440
We're going to create
a team to work on it.

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,790
This project may be difficult
in nature or complex,

79
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,620
and there's a certain degree
of uncertainty with it.

80
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,160
Now if we compare that to something that's

81
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,840
business as usual, that would be something

82
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,761
that's ongoing, there's a stable team

83
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,400
or a stable idea around how to do it.

84
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,960
There's this routineness
to it, we do it every day.

85
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,810
For example, I am always
going to be adding new users

86
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,050
to our system, that is
just something that happens

87
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,970
all the time, we don't need
a special project for that.

88
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,780
And there's this degree of certainty.

89
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,410
We know that if we do
steps one, two and three,

90
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,060
we're going to get output a.

91
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,260
But with a project, we have to figure out

92
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,650
what are the steps, what
order should they done

93
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,800
so that we can get the
output that we desire,

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,050
and that's the big difference between

95
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,900
business as usual and projects.

96
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,853
In this course we're going
to focus solely on projects.
