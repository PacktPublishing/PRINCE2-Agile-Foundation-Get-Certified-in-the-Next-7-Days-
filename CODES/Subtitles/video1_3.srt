00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,270
- In this short video,
I'm going to show you

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,800
how you can get your exam
voucher for about $50 off.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,040
Now normally when you take

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,720
the PRINCE2 Agile Foundation exam,

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,810
you're going to take it
online through peoplecert.org.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,410
Now, as you go back and look
at the price of this exam,

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,880
it's going to vary by country,

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,350
but in the United States
it's $349, as shown here.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,760
Now, depending where you are in the world,

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,810
it'll be a little bit
more, or a little bit less.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,060
If you want to buy your exam
voucher through PeopleCert,

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,350
you can do that by booking your exam here,

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,890
and you'll go through and
schedule the date and time.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,530
Now, you can go ahead and
schedule your exam right here,

15
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,300
or you can save a little bit of money

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,520
by taking one extra step.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,100
You can go to diontraining.com,
and on the front

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,390
of our homepage, you'll
see the exam button.

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,060
If you click on that exam button,

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,400
what you're going to see is all
of our exam vouchers for sale.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,190
Any of the exams that we
teach, such as ITIL 4,

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,350
ITIL, PRINCE2, or PRINCE2
Agile Foundations,

23
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,550
you can go and get your
vouchers through us.

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,780
As you can see on the screen,

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,210
the current price for
this voucher is $299,

26
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,270
a $50 savings off buying
it through PeopleCert.

27
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,630
Now when you buy it from us,

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,450
we're going to collect your
credit card information,

29
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,070
and instantly fulfill that voucher,

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,250
if it's in stock, back to your email,

31
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,290
where you'll receive a one-time use code.

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,090
Once you have that one-time
use code in your email,

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,080
you're going to go and
click and create an account

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,390
by going to the little
icon, and going down

35
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,900
to create an account, if
you're new to PeopleCert.

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,180
If you've taken an ITIL exam,
or a PRINCE2 exam before,

37
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,270
you'll actually have an account,

38
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,360
and you'll just sign in to your account.

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,120
Once you go here, you're going to go ahead

40
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,870
and enter your information, so
I'm going to put in Jason Dion,

41
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,870
my email address will be
youremail@youremail.com,

42
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,970
again you'll enter your
own information here,

43
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,880
and then you'll select
your country of residence,

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,600
mine is United States, and
then you'll give it a password,

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
and you're going to agree to those terms

46
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,030
and conditions for the privacy,

47
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,270
and if you'd like to receive marketing

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,500
from PeopleCert, you
can check that as well.

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,743
Once you do that, click
on join PeopleCert.

50
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,960
Now that you're logged into
your PeopleCert account,

51
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,720
and you have your exam voucher,

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,080
you can go and enter that
exam voucher up here,

53
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,720
and then click on confirm.

54
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,700
Once you do that, it'll bring
up a date and time calendar

55
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,240
for you to select the day and time

56
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,100
that works best for your schedule.

57
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,370
Once you select that, it'll
show up here under My exams,

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,380
and you'll come back here about 30 minutes

59
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,940
before your scheduled time
to be able to sign in,

60
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,823

needed, and begin your exam.
