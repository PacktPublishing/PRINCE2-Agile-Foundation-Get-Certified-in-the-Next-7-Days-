1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,330
- We've come a long way in the last couple

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,470
of hours together.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,230
We started out talking about PRINCE2

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,410
and the seven principles,
the seven themes,

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,030
and the seven processes,
then we went in through all

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,280
of the different Agile
techniques, behaviors,

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,840
concepts and tools.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,030
Then we brought them all together

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,140
and talked about how we
can apply those Agile ways

10
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,130
of working inside of
the PRINCE2 principles,

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,180
themes, and processes.

12
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,560
At this point, you should
know everything you need

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,740
to be successful on exam day.

14
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,350
I want you to go through and
take the practice exam now,

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,960
go over your answers,
and see how you score.

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,890
Good luck on the exam,
and I hope to see you

17
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,053
in a future course.
