1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,340
- Our next process is
managing a stage boundary.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,130
This process is the one
that gets tailored the most

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,360
out of any other process
inside of PRINCE2 Agile.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,510
The reason is because
you may not even have

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,400
well defined stages
inside of PRINCE2 Agile.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,810
Instead, you may be relying
on sprints and releases.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,750
Because of this,

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,710
we're always going to be doing
continued viability decisions,

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,180
we're not going to plan them
in advance at stage boundaries

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,670
like we would in normal print.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,600
Instead, we're constantly looking at

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,890
is this project being successful
at achieving what we want,

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,560
and does it continue to be viable?

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,060
If not, we would stop
it and move into closing

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,130
a project process instead.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,380
We're always going to
be asking the question

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,790
how are things progressing?

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,630
And how is the team and the
processes working together?

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,780
Is this working out well or is it not,

20
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,470
and what can we do to fix it?

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,410
And because of all this,

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,650
we don't have this big formal boundary

23
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,020
like we would in normal PRINCE2.

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,120
The biggest thing we're
going to do inside tailoring

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,260
this process is doing things
to look back, look forward,

26
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,990
and look at the big picture.

27
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,840
As we look back,

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,080
we want to think about
how did we do so far?

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,710
How much stuff has been delivered?

30
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,370
What quality has been achieved?

31
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,440
Was the benefit that we
thought would be delivered

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,940
delivered successfully?

33
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,010
Is the processes working well?

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,300
And did we do our reviews and
our retrospectives properly

35
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,550
to be able to gather
those lessons learned?

36
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,000
Then, we're going to look forward,

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,120
and we're going to start
planning our next stage.

38
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,420
What things are going to be
put into the next release

39
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,630
or the next sprint?

40
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,210
We're going to review our
product and our release backlogs.

41
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,380
Do we have enough work
that's in the ready bucket

42
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,840
for us to be able to start moving forward

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,900
into the next stage or the next
release or the next sprint?

44
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,150
And we're going to start planning,

45
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,520
what is that next release
going to look like?

46
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,920
We also then have to look
at the bigger picture.

47
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,670
We need to review the business case again

48
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,430
and the project plan and make
sure we're still on track

49
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,190
and we're still meeting
the goals that this project

50
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,560
was set out to achieve.

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,630
We also need to look at
the performance of Agile

52
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,940
and how it's working
inside our environment.

53
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,440
Is Agile going to be
continually a way to work

54
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,980
in this particular project?

55
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,560
Or do we need more
governance and more control

56
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,910
and less agility?

57
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,590
Or, do we have less
governance and less control

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,370
because the project is
becoming more certain

59
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,310
and less risky,

60
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,790
and we're going to allow more
agile development to happen.

61
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,460
This is the thing we have to decide

62
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,380
as whether we're going to continue forward

63
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,100
or we're going to stop the project,

64
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,400
and that's the way we
manage a stage boundary

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,370
inside the agile way of working.

66
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,320
It's a lot different than
what we see in a normal

67
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,580
PRINCE2 scenario,

68
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,000
because in a normal PRINCE2 scenario,

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,770
there's this formal deadline,

70
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,190
this formal place that we stop and look,

71
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,020
should we move forward or not?

72
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,470
Inside agile, we don't
do that nearly as much.

73
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,130
Instead, we're trying to make sure

74
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,610
our processes are improving,

75
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,270
our benefits are being realized,

76
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,990
and work has been getting done,

77
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,740
and if it is, and it's still viable,

78
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,410
we'll continue to move forward.

79
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,620
So how does controlling
a stage look inside

80
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,930
this agile process?

81
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,650
Well, it's going to be very visual.

82
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,640
We're going to use things
like the information radiator

83
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,030
and the burn charts to
evaluate our progress.

84
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,630
We're going to look at
the facts and figures

85
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,820
from the retrospectives

86
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,140
and make sure that the
processes are working

87
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,510
and that we're getting the product out

88
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,130
that we expect to get out.

89
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,080
If we are, we can then make
the decision to move forward.

90
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,720
This is a point of formality,

91
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,600
and it's carried out with as
little ceremony as possible.

92
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,940
Unlike PRINCE2 where we
might have a big meeting

93
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,990
and a big discussion and
figure out whether or not

94
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,070
we're going to move forward,

95
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,920
a lot of times,

96
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,400
this is just the product
where we're saying

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,660
yep, continue forward,

98
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,220
and they just keep movin' on.

99
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,270
There may not even be a
formal meeting about it,

100
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,300
it may just be something
that's done through email

101
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,963
or some other informal method.
