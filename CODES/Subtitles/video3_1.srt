1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,067
- What is Agile?

2
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:03,930
Well, if you're taking this course,

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,500
I hope you at least have
an idea of what Agile is.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,080
But if not, that's okay.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,710
We're going to teach
you inside this lesson.

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,660
When we talk about Agile,
Agile was developed to address

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,643
new demands being placed on
the delivery of software.

8
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,463
Under the traditional model,
we would start a project

9
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:22,786
and it might take six months
or a year or two years

10
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:25,010
to deliver the end result.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,750
But with Agile, the goal is
to get things out quicker,

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,960
cheaper, and faster, and
in most Agile developments,

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,418
something new is being released
every two to four weeks.

14
00:00:34,418 --> 00:00:37,300
Agile can be viewed in
many different ways,

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,790
and in Prince2 Agile,
it's not just talking

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,170
about software development.

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,600
We apply this to all projects.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,870
And so we'll talk about
when it's right to use Agile

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,660
verse when it's not right to use Agile

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,640
as we move through this course.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,910
There are several well-known frameworks

22
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,070
that are out on the market

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,470
that are known as Agile ways of working.

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,567
Things like Kanban or Agile or Scrum.

25
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:01,696
And we'll talk about a lot
of these as we move forward.

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,578
Agile is characterized basically
as a family of behaviors,

27
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:07,650
concepts, and techniques.

28
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,130
There is no one way to do Agile.

29
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,370
But there are lots of
different pieces and techniques

30
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,320
that can be put together
to work in an Agile way.

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,610
And that's what Prince2 Agile tries to do

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,040
is they try to incorporate
the best of different ways

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,769
of working into a
framework that we can use

34
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,178
to deliver projects faster,
cheaper, and better than before.

35
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:30,720
Now, when we talk about the
old way of doing software,

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,270
what did it really look like?

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,803
Well, it used what's called
a waterfall development.

38
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,001
This was a very linear
process where we had an idea,

39
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,510
and then we had Phase One to Phase Two

40
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,910
to Phase Three to Phase
Four to Phase Five,

41
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,440
and we actually then delivered something.

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,870
And so you could see how this

43
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,470
moved down the ladder over time,

44
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,870
and this may Have taken
three months or six months

45
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,330
or 12 months from the time we had an idea

46
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,900
to the time something
got out in operations.

47
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,440
This is the traditional
project management method.

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,820
And this is what is shown
basically back in the processes

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,059
I showed you in the seven process lecture

50
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,610
under the original Prince2 Framework.

51
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,550
Now, when we start moving into Agile,

52
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,030
we started using things that are

53
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,600
iterative in their development.

54
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,090
We did this spiral.

55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,750
And so we kind of keep
improving a little bit at a time

56
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,450
until we get to where we want to go.

57
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,590
And so you'll notice that now
instead of having one product

58
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,710
that took us that entire
time, let's say one year,

59
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,620
to get from concept to delivery.

60
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,150
In that same time we're now
able to get four products out.

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,840
Now, are they the same
level of depth of a product?

62
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,100
Probably not.

63
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,890
But, we're getting more out,
better, faster, and cheaper.

64
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,180
And notice that the first time

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,370
we got something in operations

66
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,750
was only about 30 to 40% of
the way along this timeline.

67
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,580
And so by doing this spiral,

68
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,299
we can really get things
done quicker, faster,

69
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,000
and get things into the hand of our user.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,300
That's the whole idea of Agile.

71
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,260
If we want to get
something out there quickly

72
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,960
so we can get feedback on it, better it,

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,110
improve upon it, and
then put out Version Two,

74
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,780
Version Three, and Version Four.

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,557
And by doing that, we get a
lot better product in the end.

76
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:07,320
Now, this whole thing
about Agile was created

77
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,951
based on a document called
the Agile Manifesto.

78
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:12,716
This is the closest
single definition of Agile

79
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,100
you're going to be able to find.

80
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,980
And it was created as this alternative

81
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,618
to that slower waterfall
development process.

82
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:20,970
So if you pull up the Agile Manifesto,

83
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,297
you'll see that it starts out this way.

84
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:25,987
"We are uncovering better
ways of developing software

85
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:28,617
"by doing it and helping others do it.

86
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:31,107
"Through this work, we have come to value

87
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,258
"these four things:

88
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:36,967
"individuals and interactions
over processes and tools.

89
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,567
"Working software over
comprehensive documentation.

90
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:44,077
"Customer collaboration
over contract negotiation.

91
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:47,328
"And responding to change
over following a plan.

92
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,661
"That is, while there is value
on the things on the right,

93
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:53,498
"we value the things on the left more."

94
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:55,670
So, what this really breaks down

95
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,920
is the fact that Agile
is a team-based approach.

96
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,910
They focus on these individuals
and this interaction

97
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,700
that happens to bridge communications

98
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
instead of doing things based on processes

99
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,930
and tools and the old ways.

100
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,020
They focus on getting working
software out there quicker

101
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,270
and faster as opposed to having a product

102
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,970
that may be perfect and well-documented,

103
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,440
but it took three years
to get it to market.

104
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,627
They focus on this customer collaboration

105
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,140
where it's actually a
process where the customer

106
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,300
and the supplier are working together

107
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,040
to get this product to market,

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,920
as opposed to the traditional
contract negotiations

109
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,570
where everything is written
up formally, legally,

110
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,380
and with a scope of work.

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,550
They work on responding to change

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,590
over this following of a plan

113
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,940
because things change in the development.

114
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,610
If you're building a
website and somebody says,

115
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,280
you know what, I don't
want it to blue, I want it

116
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,820
to be purple, can you go
through and change that quickly?

117
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,440
Or do we have to go back to
a new contract negotiation?

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,850
In the old methods, we would have

119
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,790
to go back to a contract negotiation.

120
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,260
But in Agile we don't.

121
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,832
We're able to work
quicker, faster, and better

122
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:59,420
by using these processes
and these techniques.

123
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,470
And that is what Agile is focused on.

124
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,630
So if you're familiar
in the software world

125
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,830
and you've heard of
Agile development before,

126
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,510
you'll notice that there's generally

127
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,950
this basic perception of what Agile is.

128
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,910
And it comes down to three main things.

129
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,920
They think about it as
a time-based approach,

130
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,440
they think about it as a
collection of techniques,

131
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,010
and they think about it
in the terms of Scrum.

132
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,330
Now, when I talk about
a time-boxed approach,

133
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,870
this is where Agile likes to take things

134
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,260
and break it down instead
of into stages, into time.

135
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,466
And everything is a fixed unit of time.

136
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:32,500
And so, your time might
be every two weeks,

137
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,680
we're going to release something.

138
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,920
Or every four weeks we're
going to release something.

139
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,590
That is a time-based approach
or a time-boxed approach.

140
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,450
Now, the second thing is this

141
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,320
collection of Agile techniques.

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,990
And int he software world, a
lot of times we'll take things

143
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,880
out of different pieces of
Agile from different techniques

144
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,340
and try to combine them together

145
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,180
to get to a finished product.

146
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,140
And then finally we have Scrum.

147
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,870
Scrum has become almost
synonymous with Agile.

148
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,410
But, there are lots of
other frameworks out there

149
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,610
that are Agile that aren't Scrum.

150
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,340
And so as we try to
expand our view from just

151
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,640
this basic view of Agile
into a more wholistic view,

152
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,030
we look at how Prince2 use Agile.

153
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,000
And in Prince2, we look at Agile

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,790
beyond this basic perception.

155
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,800
We look at it more comprehensively.

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,290
We want to think about
it more as the vision,

157
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,060
the roadmap, and the releases
we want to get out there.

158
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,990
That's kind of the overarching plan.

159
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,261
We think about it in non-IT situations.

160
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,902
We can use Agile to do
all sorts of things,

161
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:29,816
from marketing campaigns to websites

162
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:32,200
to building a fixed product.

163
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,650
And we think about it in
terms of project work,

164
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,730
not as business as usual,

165
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,350
which is a lot of what Agile is used for.

166
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,880
And the final thing we think about,

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,900
is it being flow-based work,

168
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,620
where we can take more or get less

169
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,660
based on how fast we can
process through requirements.

170
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,640
With a basic perception of Agile,

171
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,530
we have a product backlog,
it's all the requirements

172
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,640
that we have from our customers.

173
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,940
We'll pick out what we're
going to use in our time box,

174
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,700
called a sprint, and say we'll take

175
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,220
five or six different requirements,

176
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,690
and we're going to work on
them this two-week period.

177
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,360
We'll get all those worked, and
we'll ship that product out.

178
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,630
And then we'll start another sprint.

179
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,040
We'll pull out more backlog.

180
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,430
We'll work on those, and
we'll ship those products out.

181
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,930
That's the way a basic Agile will work

182
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,610
in the software world.

183
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,980
Now, with Prince2 Agile,
we're going to take those

184
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,170
Agile sprints and combine them
with our Prince2 processes.

185
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,540
And so you can see here
that we have our typical

186
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,630
Agile process that only
talks about sprints.

187
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,720
But here we're going to
build in this governance

188
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,170
and control mechanism that we can use it

189
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,450
with other projects that
aren't just software.

190
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,210
And so you'll see in the
starting upper project phase

191
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,020
and the initiating a project
phase, we are going to have

192
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,297
the vision and the
product backlog created.

193
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:43,730
From that, we're going to
select what's going to go

194
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,227
into our controlling
stage, which is our sprint.

195
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,650
And here we're going to
get our sprint backlog.

196
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,470
We're going to put those into our time box

197
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,350
of two to four weeks, we're
going to work on those,

198
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,340
we're going to get the
product backlog done,

199
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,010
we're going to get the release
backlog done, and then we're

200
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,170
going to be able to get
approval to ship that product.

201
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,530
Now, this may not look very different yet,

202
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,870
but as we go through the course

203
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,170
and we talk about each
of these things in depth,

204
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,890
it really is going to tie
together and make a lot sense.

205
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,270
The idea here is that we can
apply these Agile concepts

206
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,950
to anything we want to build.

207
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,753
It doesn't have to just be software.
