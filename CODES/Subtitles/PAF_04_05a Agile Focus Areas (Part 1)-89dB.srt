1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,420
- In this lesson, we are going

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,670
to talk about some agile focus areas.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,880
And these are things that are techniques,

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,930
or procedures, or other areas

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,570
that are focused specifically on agile.

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,420
And you have to understand
these for the exam.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,271
The first one is the agilometer.

8
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:18,750
The agilometer is a way of
assessing your agile environment

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,920
in order to best tailor PRINCE2

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,810
in the most effective way.

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,690
This is going to highlight the risk areas

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,550
that we have if we decide to use agile,

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,600
and the benefit areas if
we are going to use agile.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,660
This helps the project board
make an informed decision

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,510
when deciding exactly how
much agile we should use.

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,040
This is performed on a pre-project basis,

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,650
and it is repeated at each
of the stage boundaries.

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,350
And the project manager is going to help

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,284
to facilitate this assessment.

20
00:00:45,284 --> 00:00:47,880
You can see that there are six key areas

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,200
that are going to be assessed.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,410
And we are going to grade them

23
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,340
from one all the way up to five,

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,580
with one being the lowest
and five being the highest.

25
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,190
When we talk about one, this is going to

26
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,910
to be things where we don't feel that

27
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,000
the project environment
is well suited for agile

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
because of the way our
organization operates.

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,440
So if I look at the flexibility
on what is delivered,

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,530
how flexible is your organization

31
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,570
with what that final product will be?

32
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,210
If we have a lot of flexibility,

33
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,250
that's going to be a five,
and it's going to be high,

34
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,890
and very focused towards using agile.

35
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,500
If it's one, and it has
to be a certain way,

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,040
then we're not going to be as likely

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,830
to use agile in this scenario.

38
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,170
The second one is level of collaboration.

39
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,860
How much collaboration is
required on the project,

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,590
and how well does our organization

41
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,955
collaborate when it works?

42
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,670
The third is ease of communication.

43
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,760
Is it really easy for us to share things

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,801
and talk with each other.

45
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:41,570
For example, if we are all
working out of the same office,

46
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,254
it's really easy for us
to get up from our desk,

47
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:46,130
walk across the room,
and talk to somebody.

48
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,850
But if our project team is going to

49
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,383
be spread out across five
or six different locations,

50
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:53,180
that's going to be more of a
challenge for communication.

51
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,870
And so we might mark
it lower on that case.

52
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,210
The next one is the
ability to work iteratively

53
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,240
and develop incrementally.

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,610
By doing this, can we work
in this spiral development,

55
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,050
or do we need everything done at once

56
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,090
for us to be able to deliver a product.

57
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,470
For example, if I was
going to give you a car,

58
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,180
and the customer required a car to drive

59
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,860
from point a to point b,

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,230
can you really work on that incrementally?

61
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,310
Well some pieces you can,
but at the end of the day,

62
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,600
the customer doesn't
want a half-finished car.

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,090
They want a full car.

64
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,990
And so being able to have
that full product means

65
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,200
that we would be very low

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,570
when we are measuring how agile we can be.

67
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,850
Conversely, if I'm building
a software product,

68
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,409
I can probably be very
high on the agile meter

69
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,910
because I'm able to figure
out and put pieces of it

70
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,670
and add functionality later
and very quickly and easily.

71
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,210
Another good example of this is

72
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,690
if I'm building a satellite.

73
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,440
Once you launch that satellite
into orbit, it's up there.

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,800
You can't go and add
another piece to it later.

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,665
And so that is a very
low agile way of working.

76
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:55,547
The fifth area we are
going to to consider is

77
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:58,690
an anvantageous environmental conditions.

78
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,180
Is our environment that we're going

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,189
to be operating this project in culturally

80
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,700
and available to work in an agile method?

81
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,940
Some cultures are very agile focused,

82
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,150
and others are very procedural.

83
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,770
And based on that, you're
going to figure out

84
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,900
if you are low or high in that area.

85
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,460
And the final one, the
sixth and final one,

86
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,870
is going to be the acceptance of agile.

87
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,365
Do we accept agile as a way

88
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:23,210
of practice inside our organization?

89
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,920
If you're in a software
development company,

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,870
you are probably very high on this.

91
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,140
But if you're a commercial
builder you might be much lower.

92
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,481
And so we have to decide how
accepting is the organization

93
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,520
in terms of agile before
we can implement it.

94
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,210
And now when we get all of these,

95
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,750
we're going to mark them down on the chart

96
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,140
of where we think we are.

97
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,385
We're not going to average them.

98
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,660
Each one is considered individually.

99
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,870
But this is going to give us an idea

100
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,150
of how agile we think we can
be inside of our environment.

101
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,810
And if you're less agile, it doesn't mean

102
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,951
that you can't use agile at all.

103
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,700
It just means you're
going to have more control

104
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,430
and more governance, and
tighter tolerances placed

105
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,240
than if you were a highly
agile organization.

106
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,880
Now as I mentioned, when you grade these,

107
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,890
you're going to grade these pre-project.

108
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,310
So all the back in starting up a project.

109
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,480
That's going to say,
here's were we are today,

110
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,300
but every time we hit stage
boundary, we're going to reassess.

111
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,490
And so these can change over time.

112
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,060
You may see that over the course

113
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,960
of your project people start getting used

114
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,590
to working in an agile way.

115
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,800
And so these sliders might
move more towards the right,

116
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,700
and more towards the high side.

117
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,890
Now, once you've gone through

118
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,033
and you've assessed
each of these six areas,

119
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,860
you're going to be
considering them in isolation.

120
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,240
We don't want to average them.

121
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,420
We don't want to add them up.

122
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,360
This isn't a sum total game.

123
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,274
Instead we're looking at how agile we are

124
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,433
in each of these six areas.

125
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,140
This will give us a picture

126
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,060
of how agile this project can be,

127
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,101
or how little this project will be agile.

128
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:47,921
The question is not yes or
no, should I use agile or not.

129
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,390
The question is, how much
agile should I be using?

130
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,076
If we're a highly agile organization,

131
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,020
I'm going to give good tolerances

132
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,940
and let my teams go out and build

133
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,240
the thing they need to build.

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,470
If we are less of an agile organization,

135
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,090
I'm going to have tighter tolerances,

136
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,390
and add more governances,
and more oversight

137
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,330
as we go through the process.

138
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,418
This is going to represent
our starting point.

139
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:10,780
Now these assessments are done

140
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,630
every time we hit a stage boundary.

141
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,970
And so we are going to go back

142
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,330
and look at where we are
today as an organization.

143
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,850
And, when we hit that stage boundary,

144
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,820
where we are at that point.

145
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,490
As we see, these sliders may improve

146
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,490
or they may go backwards.

147
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,310
We're always trying to get more agile

148
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,240
depending on the project we're working on.

149
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,640
But in general, more agile
is going to be better

150
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,660
because it's going to
help us reduce our cost,

151
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,560
hit our time goals, and deliver a product

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,833
that our customer wants.


1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,462
- The next thing we're going
to talk about is requirements,

2
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:05,506
and requirements are the
currency of an Agile project.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,060
Requirements are going to tell
us what this product is going to

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,104
look like at the end.

5
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:12,485
We'll start with high-level
requirements, these are things

6
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:14,470
like project product descriptions.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,498
It's the vision for the
product, it's product groupings,

8
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:20,864
we also might call these 'epics'
or 'huge stories' that give

9
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,064
us lots of features with
these high-level requirements.

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,703
And when we do that, we're
going to use a thing called the

11
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:29,613
MoSCoW prioritization, which
we'll talk about later.

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,249
This'll help us prioritize
those requirements in the things

13
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:36,864
must have, we should have, we
can't have, and we won't have.

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,149
Now, when we look at lower-level
requirements, this is down

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,352
at the team level.

16
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:42,434
These are our project
descriptions, they are our

17
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:45,684
requirements, they are
detailed features, they're user

18
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:48,988
stories that say "as a user,
I want to be able to do this

19
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,674
thing with the product".

20
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:53,212
And they're going to have these
lower-level requirements as

21
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,863
we go through, to really
give us the detail we need

22
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:57,234
to build across.

23
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:59,884
We're going to prioritize these
based on order, what is the

24
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:03,166
most important and what is
the least important, as we go

25
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,294
through and we work
through those problems.

26
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,632
Now as we move forward when
we look at these requirements,

27
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,936
we're going to start out all
the way with this big project

28
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,544
product description at the top.

29
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:14,717
This is a very high-level requirement.

30
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,162
We can then break that down.

31
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:19,329
So if I'm talking about a car,
we have a car as our project

32
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,672
product description.

33
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:23,583
It's going to have X amount
of seats, X amount of doors

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,021
and tires, you know, it's going
to be able to do this type

35
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:27,590
of thing.

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,892
Now, we don't know all of the
details that go in to making

37
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:33,302
that car yet, we just know we need a car.

38
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,714
We start breaking that down,
and so we'll have the engine

39
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:38,736
product group, we'll have
the electrical product group,

40
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:41,565
we will have the comfort
product group, right?

41
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:43,232
We'll have the safety
product group, which might be

42
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,437
the airbags and the brakes
and things like that.

43
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:46,996
And then we'll take on of those
product groups, like let's

44
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,747
say we're going to take the
electronics group, and in

45
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:51,784
that electronics group we're
going to break that down in

46
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,757
to different product descriptions as well.

47
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:56,123
We might have on for the radio,
we might have another one

48
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:57,510
for the headlights.

49
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,815
And then underneath the radio
we'll have the different

50
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:00,477
functions it should require.

51
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,619
In this radio, we need and
AM/FM radio, we need a tape

52
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,253
player, we need a CD player,
the ability to hook up

53
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,427
an iPhone, whatever those things are.

54
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:10,830
And you can see we take it
from this big, overwhelming

55
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,906
product, right, this car,
we've broken it down to

56
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,633
the electronics, and then
from the electronics down to

57
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,593
the radio, and from the
radio down to the different

58
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:19,692
functions.

59
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:21,683
And as we went from higher-level
to lower-level, we should

60
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,090
get more detailed in the
level of requirements we're

61
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,413
going to do.

62
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,015
Now, this is called decomposition,
and we'll talk more about

63
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,888
this as we go through.

64
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,912
The next Agile focus area we
have is rich communication,

65
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:35,735
because communication
problems can really derail

66
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,718
your project.

67
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,512
Whenever you can, you need
to proactively address

68
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:43,551
communication problems and
fix them, early and often.

69
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,464
Effective communication is
so fundamental to the way

70
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,423
we work in Agile, because
everything is team-based

71
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:52,311
and collaborative, and if
we can't communicate, we're

72
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:54,827
going to fall apart really
quickly, and we're not going to

73
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,060
be able to work in an Agile method.

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,078
Communication can take place
in many different formats.

75
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:03,184
It can be the traditional
E-mail or text message.

76
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,917
It can be written word,
such as writing it down on

77
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,897
a piece of paper or on a whiteboard.

78
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,607
It can be visualization by
drawing out pictures and using

79
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,189
kanban charts and things like that.

80
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,599
We can do it verbally
over the telephone or even

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,620
face-to-face.

82
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,528
There are lots and lots of
different ways to communicate

83
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:20,361
nowadays.

84
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,508
You have to figure out what's
going to be the best one that's

85
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:24,195
going to work well in your team.

86
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:28,798
Now, according to the Prince2
Agile exam, the best, fastest,

87
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:32,177
clearest, and most efficient
way to communicate is still

88
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,343
old-fashioned face-to-face communication.

89
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,794
Whenever possible, get
everyone in a room and talk to

90
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,272
them eye-to-eye.

91
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:42,024
By doing this, this is going
to help reduce the level

92
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:44,797
of formality, and it's
going to allow us to be able

93
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,716
to communicate quickest and
fastest because a lot of our

94
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:50,650
communication happens
through body language.

95
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,314
Now, when you deal with
technology, technology and your

96
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,209
level of formality needs
to be considered because if

97
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,138
you're across three or four
different states, you might have

98
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,026
to rely on things like Skype
to use video conferencing,

99
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,718
or you may have to just use E-mails.

100
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,688
These are things you're going
to have to consider as part

101
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:07,818
of your project.

102
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:10,219
Sometimes you need a
high level of formality.

103
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,968
If you're going to be putting
up a report, for instance,

104
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,562
that would be in written
form, not face-to-face

105
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,922
communication.

106
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,429
Written word does have it's
place, but there are a lot

107
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:22,120
of disadvantages when
dealing with written word.

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,002
Have you ever gotten a text
message from somebody and

109
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,810
you're not exactly sure if
they were joking or not?

110
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,668
Well if they had told you
that face-to-face, you

111
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,912
would've known, right?

112
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:31,312
Because you can read the body language.

113
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,584
And this is one of those
drawbacks from written word

114
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:34,417
to verbal.

115
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:37,758
Your project manager or your
team manager is going to be

116
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:41,062
responsible and aware of
how this team is going to be

117
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,141
communicating.

118
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,403
It's their responsibility
to come up with a good

119
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:48,080
communication plan and help
encourage the team to use it.

120
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,039
Communication does need to
be organized and it does

121
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,392
need to be planned.

122
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,514
One of the ways that we do
that is our daily stand-up

123
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,880
meetings as part of
our Scrum cycle, right?

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,795
Every morning we stand up
and for 15 minutes we go over

125
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,588
what we did yesterday and
what we're going to do today.

126
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:05,127
That's part of rich
communication, and again when that

127
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:07,941
can occur face-to-face that
is going to be the best way

128
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,506
of doing it.

129
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,626
One of the questions I
often get asked when people

130
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:14,605
start working an Agile
environment is: "How should I

131
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,793
communicate?", and I will
tell you that I am a big fan

132
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,978
of face-to-face communication
and using a lot of

133
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,317
visualization.

134
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,395
Because if I can draw
something up on the board, it's

135
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:27,706
going to be a lot clearer
than if we use a lot of words,

136
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:31,187
and so a three-page E-mail
is not nearly as effective

137
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:33,543
as a one-page infographic.

138
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:35,811
So that's the idea here
with visualization and then,

139
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:38,411
if I can do that in a face-to-face
manner, that's going to

140
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,574
eliminate a lot of
those questions as well.

141
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,918
So for the exam, remember
lots of visualization, lots

142
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,190
of face-to-face.

143
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,868
These are good things when
you're trying to communicate

144
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:47,865
effectively.



1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:02,475
- The next Agile focus area is called

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:04,658
The Information Radiator
or the Team Board.

3
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:07,815
This is something that is
placed in your team's workspace

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,569
that allows you to visualize everything

5
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:12,041
that's being worked on.

6
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,675
So you can see here, we have the goal.

7
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,613
We're going to define
that the project is going

8
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:18,187
to be done by the end of the year.

9
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:19,523
Underneath that, you can see we have the

10
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:21,464
Kanban chart, showing
what is to be worked on

11
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:25,311
what's in progress, and what
is ready to be pushed out.

12
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:27,159
We can also see our team rules.

13
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,777
What are the things that our
team is going to buy into?

14
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,605
In this case: We should all be honest,

15
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,908
we should all be open
and everyone has a say.

16
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,978
So, really valuing that collaboration.

17
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:38,645
Then we go up on the other side.

18
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,674
We have our effort versus
time graph, which is

19
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,247
known as a burn down chart.

20
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,340
You could see the amount of
work that needs to be done

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,863
and the amount of time we have left.

22
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:48,404
And then, in the bottom corner,
we have issues and news.

23
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:50,561
And this is going to
be a way to tell people

24
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,970
new things about the
team, and what's happening

25
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,064
in the world around us and
things we have to consider

26
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:57,962
and the issues are things
we have problems with.

27
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,076
And those are issues
that we're bringing up

28
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:02,450
to the project manager
and the team manager

29
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,609
so they can help us deal with those issues

30
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:07,427
and make sure that we stay
on time and on budget.

31
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:10,619
Again, this is a great way
of visualizing information

32
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,955
and showing everybody what's going on.

33
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,144
Being open, being transparent and enabling

34
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:18,293
that rich communication
as we move forward.

35
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:21,777
Frequent releases are another
key concept inside of Agile.

36
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,649
With frequent releases, we're
really focused on releasing

37
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:28,022
something quickly that is
usable to the end customer.

38
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,703
This is going to be something
like a prototype or a beta

39
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,788
or it could be our finalized product.

40
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,495
Either way, it's going to
require a lot of planning

41
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,393
on our part, and we do this
using product-based planning

42
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:40,330
where we start with the end in mind.

43
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,232
What is this product we're trying to build

44
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,479
breaking it down into its component pieces

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,289
and putting it together.

46
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:48,572
There's a lot of advantages
to doing frequent releases.

47
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:50,929
The first is that you get early delivery

48
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,523
of benefits to your customer.

49
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,350
The customer gets something they can start

50
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,991
working with, and as they
start working with it,

51
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,969
they start going "Oh,
this isn't working the

52
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,852
"way I thought it was going to work".

53
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,391
And they give you
feedback, that allows you

54
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,871
to iterate for the next cycle.

55
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,843
This helps reduce the risk of
delivering the wrong product.

56
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:08,000
If I was going to build the entire product

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,417
from start to finish,
it may take me a year.

58
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,547
But if I can give them
something to look at,

59
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:14,676
maybe a wire frame diagram
of the app we're building

60
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,262
or may be able to give them a
couple of features to try out,

61
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,857
we could start to figure
out are we on the right path

62
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,506
to getting the final product?

63
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,000
Or, do we need to change
and adjust where we are?

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,868
This also gives us confidence

65
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,485
in how the project is progressing.

66
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,092
Because, if the customer keeps going

67
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:30,841
"Yes, this is good", "Yes, this is good"

68
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,344
"Yes, this is good" as we go along these

69
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,696
iterations, it really
does help the team know

70
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,446
they're on the right path.

71
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:40,655
This also is going to foster
better stakeholder engagement.

72
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,465
Because, the customer is
something they can touch

73
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,672
it's something they can
use and see if it's working

74
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,087
the way they wanted it to.

75
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:48,132
And, the final thing,
is it makes releasing

76
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,138
products easier. It
doesn't have to be this

77
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,812
big, huge deal where we release a product.

78
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:54,187
Because if we release
something, and it's not

79
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:57,077
quite right, we can go
back and iterate it again.

80
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,008
Whereas, if you use a waterfall approach,

81
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:01,460
it may have taken you a
year or two years to get

82
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,952
to this final product release.

83
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,854
And then, if you went
and hit the wrong thing,

84
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:07,938
that is going to be
devastating to your team.

85
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,948
So, frequent releases really are helpful

86
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,492
in the Agile way of working.

87
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,774
The next focus area we
have is Retrospectives.

88
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:17,067
And, retrospectives are a technique

89
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,997
that we use at the end of a sprint.

90
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,065
This is a technique
when we're working in an

91
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:24,096
agile way where we review
the ways the processes

92
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:26,285
that we use to get the product done.

93
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,946
This is something that we
have to plan and structure.

94
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:31,277
And it's going to cover
what went wrong and what

95
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,660
didn't go well.

96
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,593
Was there good communication involved?

97
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:36,601
Was there good collaboration?

98
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,545
What is working and what isn't?

99
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,491
We're going to improve little by little,

100
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:43,027
continuously, early, and often.

101
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,710
Because this is going
to help us get better

102
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,304
in the next sprint,
and in the next sprint,

103
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,128
and then the next sprint.

104
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,821
We also want to make sure
that the retrospectives

105
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:52,103
are efficient, and
effective, and to do this,

106
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,901
we might introduce variety.

107
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,733
Maybe, sometimes, we're going to do them

108
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,685
as a workshop. Maybe sometimes we're going

109
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:59,880
to do them as a lunch meeting.

110
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,965
Whatever it is, we want
to kind of break it up

111
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,023
a little bit so it is
not just so monotonous.

112
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:06,256
But, this is a great
way to gather feedback

113
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:10,923
in the forms of facts or feelings
of what you felt went well

114
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,118
Or, what actually went well.

115
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,030
Or, what you felt wasn't good.

116
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,832
Or, what really didn't go well.

117
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,860
And, by being table to
take all this information

118
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,724
we can learn from that experience

119
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,863
and improve ourself as we move forward.

120
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:26,567
Retrospectives are really key
to that continual improvement

121
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,989
as we move forward throughout

122
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:30,190
the processes, working in an agile way.

123
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,527
And, one of the ways we do that

124
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:32,937
is by workshops, I said, right?

125
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:35,452
Well, workshops are run as a way for us

126
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,118
to gather the information.

127
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:40,327
It uses live, face to
face interaction workshop

128
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,643
as a way to gather these lessons learned.

129
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:46,089
A workshop is run usually
by a neutral facilitator,

130
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,308
who can manage the workshop and make sure

131
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,535
the process is being done properly.

132
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,094
It is going to allow to get

133
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,761
these interactions and creativity.

134
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,517
We can use this for a retrospective.

135
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,134
But, we can also use this
for the prioritization

136
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:00,889
in creating all the
requirements for the product.

137
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,441
Workshops can be used at
any point during a project.

138
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,649
And, they're really useful
both at the beginning

139
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,738
of the project, with the
requirements gathering,

140
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,599
but also at the end of each sprint,

141
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,709
using them for retrospectives.

142
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:16,232
Now, this can help us get
quality outputs quickly,

143
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,579
if you conduct the proper preparation.

144
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,412
And, there are a couple
key areas you want to think

145
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:22,513
about, when preparing for this workshop.

146
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,453
You want to make sure that you've defined

147
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:26,314
what the objective of the workshop is.

148
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,848
Are we doing this workshop
to gather requirements?

149
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:30,979
Or, are we doing it as a retrospective?

150
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,583
We also need to figure out
who needs to be in attendance.

151
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,434
If we're going to be
gathering requirements,

152
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,743
that is going to be people
like your suppliers.

153
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,704
That is going to be
people like your customer,

154
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,072
your development team, your team manager,

155
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,592
and your project manager.

156
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,290
But, if we're going to do a retrospective,

157
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,332
we may have to bring in
other people, or less people.

158
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,922
And, so we have to think about that.

159
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,657
Logistics. You need to think about

160
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,459
where you're going to hold this workshop.

161
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,245
Is it going to be done
in a conference room?

162
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,787
Is it going to be done in a break room?

163
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,840
Is it going to be done
virtually, over technology?

164
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,937
You have to think about all of that.

165
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:02,436
And then, finally, pre-reading.

166
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,334
When you're preparing for this workshop,

167
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,707
not only are you preparing
to hold the workshop,

168
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,442
but the people who are coming
should be prepared, as well.

169
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,782
So, if we're going to go through
and we're going to develop

170
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,603
the idea for our next big product

171
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:15,677
as part of our requirements gathering,

172
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:18,673
and we're going to build a new iPhone app,

173
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:20,339
then we probably should
have some pre-reading

174
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,210
so people can understand
what's been popular

175
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,082
in the market space so far.

176
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,491
What are some of the ideas
we're already thinking about?

177
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,837
And, they can start
getting their minds ready

178
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:31,254
and in that mindset of
what we're going to do

179
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,859
when we have this workshop.

180
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,107
Now, when we do workshops, I've found

181
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,296
that there are three
great ways to hold these.

182
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,001
One is you want to make sure

183
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:40,234
you have lots of whiteboards there.

184
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,416
Because, you could write
up ideas really quickly,

185
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,866
you can erase them if they're bad,

186
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,885
and you can keep moving on.

187
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,311
Workshops should also
be group-working focus.

188
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,800
Everyone should be involved.

189
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,890
It shouldn't be one person
running the whole show

190
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,499
and answering all of the questions.

191
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,132
You want to get everybody involved in it,

192
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,219
because the best ideas come
from that collaboration

193
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,528
when we're working in an agile way.

194
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,465
And the other thing I
find works really well

195
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,493
is sticky notes, especially when you are

196
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,931
doing your requirements gathering.

197
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:06,332
Because, you can write it
down really quickly on a note

198
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,259
and stick it up on that whiteboard

199
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,936
and move them around very quickly.

200
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,797
And then, at the end, snap a picture of it

201
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,599
and you've got your work board

202
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,871
that you can start working from.

203
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,490
So this is just some of
the ideas that you have,

204
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,339
when you start working
through these workshops.

205
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,862
And, the more you practice them,

206
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:21,241
the better you're going to get.
