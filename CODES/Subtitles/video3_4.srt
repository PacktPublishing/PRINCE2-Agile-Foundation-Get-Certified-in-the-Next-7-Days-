1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,200
- So, how do we use Scrum in our projects?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,090
Well, when we start using Scrum,

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,410
we're trying to do it to
create some sort of product

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,050
that can be sent out when we're done.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,883
Right?

6
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:13,540
And that comes down to
three different areas.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,340
We have a product
backlog, a sprint backlog,

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,550
and then a final shippable product.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,080
All of these are known as artifacts.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,180
Now the product backlog is
something that's going to list all

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,350
of the features, all of the
requirements, the enhancements,

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,550
and the fixes that we
propose for future releases.

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,400
This is done by using
epics and user stories,

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,700
and we'll talk about both of those more

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,580
as we go through the course.

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,990
Continually, over time,

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,890
we're going to keep
refining these backlog ideas

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,350
and we're going to add details
to them, estimates to them,

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,280
and order and prioritization to them

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,430
until they are quote ready.

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,760
When something is ready,

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,150
it's put into what's
called the ready status.

23
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,150
This means it's a product
that can be actually moved

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,740
into the development
team for them to work on

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,270
until it's done and ready to be shipped.

26
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,860
And so, once we get this
requirement firmed up,

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,520
that's when we can call it a ready status.

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,200
Now, once we get it ready,

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,590
it can move on into what's
called the sprint backlog.

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,410
And this is where we take a set of items

31
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,500
from the product backlog and say
they're going to be worked on

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,220
during this time box and this sprint.

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,460
The items here are the ones

34
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,380
that are going to create the
highest business value for us,

35
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,530
and they're pulled by the team to work on.

36
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,820
So the development team, actually,

37
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,837
is going to go into the backlog and go,

38
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,017
"What five or six things can we work on

39
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,857
"in this next two weeks that will give

40
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,320
"us the best value for the business?"

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,020
And the way they do
this is by going through

42
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,120
and figuring out which ones
are ready for them to work on

43
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,490
and which ones have the highest priority.

44
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,270
Now, in addition to pulling
these product backlog ones

45
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,520
in to work on, they also are required

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,330
to take at least one high
priority process improvement item

47
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,100
and include that into the sprint as well.

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,210
Because part of our sprints
is trying to make sure

49
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,490
that we're always improving
and getting better.

50
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,650
So we're going to create things to finish

51
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,810
into the finish product to
get a done shippable product,

52
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,650
but we also want to fix
our processes themself

53
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,460
to get us better, faster,
and more efficient.

54
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,120
And that brings us to the last piece.

55
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,370
So, once we've taken it
from the product backlog

56
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,370
to the sprint backlog, we now finish it

57
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,410
and we put it all together into
what's called an increment.

58
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,730
An increment is the culmination of all

59
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,470
of the product backlog items

60
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,960
that were completed during this sprint.

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,010
These items are all ready
and in an usable condition

62
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,660
to be shipped, released,

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,580
and considered done and off the table.

64
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,150
Once we do that, that is something
that we release to market

65
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,230
or release as a prototype
to get more feedback on

66
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,190
as we move forward through the process.

67
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,250
And so, that's the three
artifacts that we have.

68
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,740
That product backlog, the spring
backlog, and the increment.

69
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,130
Now, as we move forward,

70
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,050
we're going to start talking
about the five events

71
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,310
inside of Scrum.

72
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,250
This is our sprint, our sprint
planning, our daily scrum,

73
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,650
our sprint review, and
our sprint retrospective.

74
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,210
Now, what are these?

75
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,520
Well, the sprint is
what we're going to use,

76
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,030
which is a time-based
event of one month or less.

77
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,620
Generally, you'll see this
as two weeks or four weeks.

78
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,980
In a sprint, we're going to
take stuff from the backlog,

79
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,670
work on it through the development team,

80
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,590
and create a done usable,
releasable increment.

81
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,423
This will allow us

82
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,910
to maintain a consistent
duration throughout the project

83
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,810
because we're always going
to use the same time box,

84
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,490
either two weeks or four weeks

85
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,440
or whatever your company is going to use.

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,460
That's the idea here with a sprint.

87
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,740
Now, as we move forward, we're
going to spring planning.

88
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,730
How do we figure out what
we're going to work on,

89
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,400
on this sprint?

90
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,680
Well, we're going to do that
through sprint planning.

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,210
And this is a plan that
is created collaboratively

92
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,510
with the entire scrum team.

93
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,350
That includes a scrum master,

94
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,970
that's going to include the product owner

95
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,560
as well as the development team.

96
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,400
They're all going to sit down
in something like a workshop,

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,233
they'll do it,

98
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,290
and it's going to take less
than eight hours per month

99
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,630
for them to sit down at
this time-boxed event

100
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,340
and decide what are we going to
work on during this increment,

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,990
during this sprint.

102
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,640
What kind of work are we going to do,

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,450
and how will the work need to
be performed to be achieved?

104
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,220
And this is why we have
the product owner there

105
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,617
because the product owner is going to say,

106
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:11,640
"This is really important,
this gives us high value,"

107
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,687
and then you have the
development team there who says,

108
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,557
"That's great, but in this two weeks

109
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:17,937
"I can only get done x amount of work,

110
00:04:17,937 --> 00:04:20,227
"so I can't do all five
high priority things.

111
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,977
"I'll take numbers one and two,

112
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:24,080
"and I'll work on the other
ones in the next sprint."

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,640
And you can start planning
out your sprints that way.

114
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,190
The next thing we're
going to talk about here

115
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,530
is our daily scrum.

116
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,750
And this is a time-boxed
event that takes 15 minutes

117
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,000
or less and it only occurs
with the development team.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,980
The development team comes in the morning,

119
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,580
they do this daily stand-up,

120
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,240
and this meeting is going
to be done to talk about

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,660
what did we do in the last 24 hours,

122
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,590
and what are we going to work on today?

123
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,450
This will help us to
identify any issues, risks,

124
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,020
or challenges, and help us
finish our increment on time,

125
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
on budget.

126
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,260
That's the idea here.

127
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,900
So, this daily scrum is
really this leveling meeting

128
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,540
that allows everybody
on the development team

129
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,330
to come together and
figure out what did we do

130
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,370
and what are we going to do today.

131
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,950
Next, we have our sprint review.

132
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,530
And this occurs at the end of your sprint.

133
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,300
This is a chance for the team to stop

134
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,760
and inspect the increment
that they just worked on

135
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,550
and adapt the product
backlog as appropriate.

136
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,020
So, if you go through the increment

137
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,560
and you test all the functions out

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,070
and you're working on five
pieces of software code

139
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,200
and one of them wasn't working right,

140
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
well, you still have a time-boxed event

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,100
and so that one piece of code
might have to get put back

142
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,250
into the product backlog to
be worked in the next sprint.

143
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,680
This is an informal meeting

144
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,920
and it's not designed as a status meeting.

145
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,120
It's for people to go through
and inspect the products.

146
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,920
This meeting should be no longer

147
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,520
than four hours per month of sprint.

148
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,090
So, if you're doing a one month sprint,

149
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,530
it can be up to four hours.

150
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,810
If you're doing the two weeks sprint,

151
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,170
it should be no more than two hours.

152
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,240
The next one we have is

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,660
what we call our sprint retrospective.

154
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,250
And this is an opportunity
for the scrum team,

155
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,880
both the product owner as
well as the development team

156
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,840
and the scrum master to come in

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,160
and inspect itself on the processes

158
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
and create plans for
improvements for the next sprint.

159
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,387
So, we might go back
and look at this and go,

160
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:08,897
"You know what, when we
were working on this piece

161
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:11,637
"of the sprint, it was
taking us three times longer

162
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,717
"than we thought it was going to be

163
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,907
"because we were missing this
type of person on the team.

164
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,257
"So, let's go ahead and get that person

165
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,990
"in the next sprint so
that it can go faster."

166
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,270
This occurs after each sprint review

167
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,810
and before you start going into

168
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,540
your sprint planning for your next stage.

169
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,520
At most, this should be a
three hour meeting per month.

170
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,630
Because, again, our goal
here is not to have people

171
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,390
in hour-long meetings over and over again,

172
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,810
we want to get it done once

173
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,250
so we can get back to work
and create more product.

174
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,650
So, as we went through
these five Scrum events,

175
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,520
the key here that I
want you to remember is

176
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,150
that these events are prescribed

177
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,130
to create regularity
throughout the process.

178
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,730
Each and every event
has a maximum duration.

179
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,530
You saw that I said
this one is three hours,

180
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,400
or that one is four hours.

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,940
The reason is we don't want
to kill people with meetings,

182
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,880
we want people to be productive.

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,010
This sprint is at the
heart of this concept.

184
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,120
We have that fixed two
week or four week sprint

185
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,660
and everything else is based
on the beginning of the sprint,

186
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,080
such as sprint planning,
or the end of the sprint,

187
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,140
such as the sprint review
and the sprint retrospective.

188
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,480
This helps force transparency
throughout the process

189
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,880
and gives us opportunities
to inspect what we built

190
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,480
and adapt our processes so
that we can become better

191
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,310
with time as we keep moving
forward throughout this process.

192
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,650
So, how do we put all of this together?

193
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,640
Well, in Scrum, it's
actually fairly simple.

194
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,720
You'll see here on the screen,
we have our product owner.

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,140
They're going to go through
and create all of the epics

196
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,840
and user stories, what we
might know as requirements

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,320
in a standard process,

198
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,220
and put them into the product backlog.

199
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,970
In this product backlog,

200
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,260
we will have it all
sitting there, ready to go.

201
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,050
These are all of the pieces
they need for the versions

202
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,570
of the products that they
want to be developed.

203
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,980
These are all the different features

204
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,880
that a customer might need.

205
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,920
The development team and the
scrum master will then work

206
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,010
at the sprint planning
meeting with the product owner

207
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,740
to pull out what is going to
come from that product backlog

208
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,830
and be put into this sprint,
which will last up to 30 days.

209
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,050
This becomes known as our sprint backlog.

210
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,660
From here, the development
team starts working.

211
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,380
And they have up to 30 days,
whether it's a two week sprint

212
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,490
or a four week sprint, to go through

213
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,410
and create all the product
that's going to be created here.

214
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,820
This will be known as the increment.

215
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,370
Each day during this
cycle, you're going to see

216
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,430
that the development team goes out

217
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,350
and has their daily scrum meeting.

218
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,750
Remember, this is no more
than 15 minutes a day.

219
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,067
During this meeting, they're going to say,

220
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:39,917
"Yesterday, I built this,
today I'm going to build that.

221
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,357
"And here with the issues I had,

222
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:43,430
"here's the risks as I see them."

223
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,130
The scrum master is there making sure

224
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,150
that process goes smoothly.

225
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,520
And we keep working through
that for the entire sprint.

226
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,800
At the end of the sprint,

227
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,740
we're going to go into our sprint review,

228
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,500
where we're going to look
at all of the products

229
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
that were created that are
now known as the increment.

230
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,910
We look through all of those products.

231
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,460
We verify their quality.

232
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,400
We make sure that
they're good for release.

233
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,170
And they are now marked as done,

234
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,250
and they get pushed
out into the increment,

235
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,943
out to the product owner,
to their final customer.

236
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,690
Right after we finish that sprint review,

237
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,960
we're going to do a sprint retrospective.

238
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,180
And that sprint retrospective
is very much focused

239
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,230
on the processes that were involved.

240
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,620
Where the sprint review was focused

241
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,147
on the quality of the increment,

242
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:28,150
the sprint retrospective is
focused on how the sprint went,

243
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,940
how was the quality of the stand-ups,

244
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,070
how was the quality of the daily meetings,

245
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,890
how was the quality of how
well the team worked together.

246
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,150
What things were they missing,

247
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,270
what things did they need more of.

248
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,360
That is what we're focused on

249
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,960
with that sprint retrospective.

250
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,040
And remember, this
meeting should be no more

251
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,220
than a couple of hours once per sprint.

252
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,730
So that's how we put it all together,

253
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,883
and that's how we move forward with Scrum.
