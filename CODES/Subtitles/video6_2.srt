1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,960
- In this lesson, we're
going to talk about

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,420
how you start up a project,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,070
and initiate a project in an Agile manner.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,490
We're going to combine the two of these

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,640
because most of the things
we're going to talk about

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,360
are applicable to both of these processes.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,480
First, we need to determine if the project

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,071
is viable and worthwhile.

9
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,667
In starting up a project,
we want to look at it

10
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,630
and start creating the outline
for this business case.

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,320
And we take all of the ideas we have

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,380
and narrow it down to one that
is going to be our project.

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,970
Now when we start doing this
inside initiating a project,

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,020
we're going to take that
outline business case

15
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,200
and develop it much more fully.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,420
We'll talk about that a little bit more

17
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,120
as we go through this lesson.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,680
We also want to ensure that we're creating

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,440
a solid foundation for
us to understand the work

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,780
that's needed to be done,
for us to take this project

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,720
from an idea to final
execution and delivery.

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,670
By doing that it's going to allow
us to create the user stories

23
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,950
and the requirements much more thoroughly,

24
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,190
and be able to understand

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,820
all of the work that needs to get done

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,400
for us to have the
final project delivered.

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,890
Next we want to make sure that
we're setting up our project

28
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,260
in an appropriate manner.

29
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,000
And that's going to make
sure that we're using

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
the right Agile terms,
the right Agile roles,

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,580
and the right organizational structures

32
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,940
to make it work in an Agile method.

33
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,320
The impact of frequent
releases of the products

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,630
is going to enable us to get
benefits early and often.

35
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,040
That continuous feedback
loop is going to help us

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,941
better define the project as
we move forward throughout it.

37
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,730
And that's one of the
key distinctions between

38
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,920
the way we do it in traditional Prince2,

39
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,030
where everything is defined early on,

40
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,960
and all the requirements are stated as

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,947
early as the initiating a project phase,

42
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,180
as opposed to an Agile where these are

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,660
continually being developed,

44
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,540
and we're continually massaging them

45
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,920
to get to the end state that
we want with our final product.

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,392
Now as we move forward
and we start looking

47
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,384
at some other things we tailor
inside of these processes,

48
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,635
we have to remember two key things.

49
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,670
We want to make sure we're
defining things at the right level

50
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,980
and that we're defining
things the right way.

51
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,338
Now what do I mean by that?

52
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:55,885
When I talk about defining
things at the right level,

53
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,913
we want to consider things like
our outputs and our outcomes.

54
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:00,760
What is the output and outcome

55
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,830
that we expect from this project?

56
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,170
When we start writing that down,

57
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,712
that will serve as our
project product description.

58
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:09,739
The baseline of our user
stories essentially.

59
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,310
We also want to consider the benefits.

60
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,641
What are the benefits we expect?

61
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,410
Traditionally, this would be done

62
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,364
in a fully written out business case.

63
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:20,570
But in Agile, it doesn't
have to be nearly as formal.

64
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,883
Instead we want to start thinking

65
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:24,110
about what's the minimum viable product.

66
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,210
What's the best and worst case scenario

67
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,980
for the amount of product
that we have to deliver?

68
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,110
And if we can define that early on here,

69
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,460
in the starting up a project or

70
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,120
initiating a project phrase,

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
then we're going to be able to
start building towards that.

72
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,850
And finally, we got to think about

73
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,280
those high-level requirements.

74
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,200
What are those epics?

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,000
What are those things that the
user wants to be able to do?

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,700
And then we bring those down lower

77
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,800
into the outputs, outcomes, and benefits.

78
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,870
And so by doing this at the right level,

79
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,578
we can really define the big rocks

80
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:53,460
getting down to smaller
rocks in level of detail.

81
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,770
As we talk about defining
things the right way,

82
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,832
we want to think about how we
can enable Agile to work easier.

83
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:00,940
And the way do this is often by

84
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,860
ensuring we are outcome focused.

85
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,172
If we focus on the outcomes and

86
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,740
we focus on the benefits,

87
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,040
that's going to enable
us to have a lot more

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,149
wiggle room in what we actually deliver.

89
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,087
If my outcome is to have a car

90
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:15,034
that drives 120 miles
an hour for three hours,

91
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,224
I can build that a lot of different ways.

92
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:19,004
I have a lot of flexibility there.

93
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,080
But if I have a very specific requirement

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,753
that says my tolerance has to
be within point one inches,

95
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:28,090
that doesn't give me a
lot of room to maneuver.

96
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,960
And so without that room to maneuver,

97
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,710
we're not going to be nearly as agile.

98
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,300
So remember that when you're defining

99
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,350
what your thing is you wanted to do.

100
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,790
What is the outcome?

101
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,130
What is the benefit?

102
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,150
And by defining those well
early on in this process,

103
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,810
we're going to be able to
build to that a lot easier.

104
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,240
As we continue to tailor
these two processes,

105
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,940
we have to think about the products

106
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,510
that are usually output
from these processes.

107
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,886
That's things like our project brief,

108
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,693
our project initiation document,

109
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,182
and our business case.

110
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,201
Let's look at the project brief first.

111
00:03:57,201 --> 00:04:00,511
Our project brief tends to be
very formal inside of Prince2.

112
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:03,791
It's a written report or it's
a PowerPoint presentation.

113
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,626
But in Agile, this can
be a lot less formal.

114
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:10,030
Instead, we're looking for
just some key components of it.

115
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,350
What methods are we going to use?

116
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,780
Are we going to use a lean start-up

117
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,930
and minimum viable product for instance.

118
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,567
If so, we would document that down.

119
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,122
And this project brief may only be

120
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,420
one slide or one piece of paper.

121
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,631
It doesn't have to be
really long and in depth.

122
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,791
Instead, we're going to make definitions

123
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,281
that are based on outcomes
instead of tight specifications.

124
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,690
We're going to make sure we're talking

125
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,550
about the fact that we're
going to use frequent delivery.

126
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,990
And frequent iteration.

127
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,011
So we get products out
to our customers sooner,

128
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:37,210
get their feedback and incorporate that

129
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,860
to make the next version.

130
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,070
This whole idea of the way
we're going to do this project

131
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,150
in an Agile method has to be documented

132
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,860
inside this project brief.

133
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,159
But again, this can be a
very informal document.

134
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,963
It could be one piece of paper,

135
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,749
it could be one whiteboard
in a conference room.

136
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,056
It doesn't really matter as long as

137
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:55,950
everyone agrees that that's
the way we're going to work.

138
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,130
Now as we look at the next thing,

139
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,520
we're going to look at our business case.

140
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,440
In our business case tends to be

141
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,944
a fairly flushed out very in depth

142
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,060
piece of paper that's written out

143
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,560
in our normal Prince2.

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,030
But in Agile, it doesn't
have to be that way.

145
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,010
Again, we're going to identify some basic

146
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,200
things inside our business case in Agile.

147
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,380
If we're going to use a
minimum viable product,

148
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,720
we need to identify that
in the business case.

149
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,840
What are the outcomes we expect to get

150
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,620
from our minimum viable product.

151
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,140
We want to talk about how
we're going to increase

152
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,556
flexing the amount of delivery
that's going to be done.

153
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:29,340
And so we want to get 80 percent
of our requirements filled.

154
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,520
But we're willing to accept as low as 60,

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,010
or we'd be happy to get
as much as 100 percent.

156
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,500
And that's something we can
cover in the business case.

157
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,192
Again, it's what's your best case,

158
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,620
what's your worse case,

159
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,320
and what's your most likely case.

160
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,690
And by giving that in
terms of amount delivered,

161
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,150
it really does work in
a much more Agile way

162
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,330
since you're going to be pulling things

163
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,706
from the back log to work
at during the sprints.

164
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:52,685
The third one we have is our
project product description.

165
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,600
This is something that's going
to focus on your outcomes.

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,460
It's going to be created
as part of a workshop

167
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,920
in a collaborative method,

168
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,960
and we're going to capture
those as user stories and epics.

169
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,750
If it's a very large project,

170
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,050
it's going to be an epic.

171
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,590
That epic is going to be made
up of many smaller stories

172
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,070
that we'll get to later
on during the process.

173
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,140
This will also be used to
create our product backlog.

174
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,670
And that product backlog
is all of the features

175
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,870
that we want to deliver and
we'll start pulling those

176
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,105
into our sprint planning to be able

177
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:21,292
to be created during our sprints.

178
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:23,860
Now our project initiation document

179
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,919
is our last document.

180
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,810
Normally, this is a very
large and complex document

181
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,794
that covers things like our
risk management strategy,

182
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:34,250
our communications management
strategy and many others.

183
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,830
Now inside of Agile,
we are going to make it

184
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,400
much less formal.

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,290
Instead of being this big document,

186
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,680
it may just exist as an
information radiator.

187
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,348
Because it's got all the
things you need in it.

188
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,170
It's got your information plan,

189
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,410
it's got your team rules,

190
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,030
it's got what issues are being tracked,

191
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,300
what new things are being tracked,

192
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,940
what progress is being tracked.

193
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,773
All of that.

194
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:55,110
And when so you think about
your project initiation document

195
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,240
in an Agile context,
you want to think about

196
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,870
what is the minimum that I have to do

197
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,230
so everyone knows what's needed?

198
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,305
And not do any extra paperwork.

199
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,990
This is going to help us plan for

200
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,609
the release of frequent releases.

201
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,970
As well as planning for the definition

202
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,120
of what is done and what is ready.

203
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
And it will also help us to
map Prince2 and our Agile

204
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
roles together.

205
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,890
Again, all of this can be shown
on an information radiator,

206
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,163
in a very informal way.

207
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,493
And we're going to make sure we tailor it

208
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,120
to be appropriate for the Agile

209
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,600
environment we're working in.

210
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,508
If we're working in a
very simple environment,

211
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,300
it may just be a board.

212
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,810
If it's a complex environment,

213
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,818
it may be a board that gives you

214
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:31,670
a summary, and we have more details

215
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,400
behind it written down on paper.

216
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,290
It just depends on how
you want to tailor this

217
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,608
to work in your project.

218
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,559
Next we're going to talk about how

219
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,270
we view starting up a project,

220
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,428
and initiating a project,

221
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,760
and what we have that
are Agile considerations.

222
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,930
And some of those are things like

223
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,060
what upfront work do we have to do?

224
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,630
And how much of it before we can

225
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,100
start getting into actually
doing something in a sprint?

226
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,710
And this is done through
what's called a sprint zero,

227
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,810
or discovery phase.

228
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,199
During sprint zero, which may be called

229
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,030
the initiation stage,

230
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,674
back in a traditional Prince2 model,

231
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,367
we're going to go through
and do our visioning,

232
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,640
and our chartering and
getting people together

233
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,750
to say "What is the grand
scheme for this product?

234
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,920
What is it we hope to have as an outcome?"

235
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,640
And as we start building this vision,

236
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,840
we can then start creating our backlog.

237
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,480
We're going to use workshops
and information communication,

238
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,640
whether formal or informal
to figure all this out.

239
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,809
And we put all this together,

240
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,300
we're going to start figuring out

241
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,846
what is the minimum thing
we need to start delivering,

242
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:27,650
and what is enough.

243
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,958
What means we are done?

244
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,010
And those are things we're
going to define here,

245
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,696
inside of the starting up a project,

246
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:34,527
and initiating a project phase.

247
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,610
Because we have to know what done is,

248
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,812
otherwise how will we ever
know if we ever got there?

249
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:40,372
The next thing we need to talk about

250
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:42,020
is the Agile behaviors,

251
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,526
and how do you asses those five behaviors

252
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:47,261
of transparency, collaboration,
rich communication,

253
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,860
self-organization, and exploration.

254
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,430
One of the common ways to do it

255
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,260
in starting up a project phase,

256
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,210
is to use a stop light chart.

257
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,813
And this is red, yellow, and green.

258
00:08:56,813 --> 00:08:59,040
Red means there's some kind of significant

259
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,530
problem or exception.

260
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,730
Yellow means things are tracking poorly

261
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,749
and we should be concerned.

262
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:05,699
And green means
everything's good right now,

263
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:07,270
but we should monitor it because

264
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,559
it may be a problem later on.

265
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,377
And so this is just a very simple

266
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,322
way for you to look
across your organization

267
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,790
and see how they're
implementing Agile behaviors

268
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,054
inside of your project.

269
00:09:16,054 --> 00:09:19,340
Another method of assessing
your organization,

270
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,800
beyond just the five behaviors,

271
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,400
is to look at it with the Agilometer.

272
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,751
Looking at those six key areas.

273
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,552
Again, we're going to look at this,

274
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:27,950
and we're going to put them on a

275
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,687
sliding scale from one to five.

276
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:32,920
How low or how high they
are in regards to Agile.

277
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,150
We're going to use each
of these in isolation,

278
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,760
and we're not going to average them up.

279
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,540
But this will give us an idea
of where our organization is,

280
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,640
and where our risks lie.

281
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,300
The last area that we want to measure

282
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,719
inside our project early on
is the level of uncertainty.

283
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,410
How certain or uncertain is this project?

284
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,894
And how complex or not
complex is this project?

285
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:55,174
To do that, we use a tool
called the Cynefin framework.

286
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:57,326
The Cynefin framework is a
decision making framework

287
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:01,360
that helps us determine the
exact level of complexity

288
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,740
in relation to our project
and the project environment.

289
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,160
This is going to tell us how much

290
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,220
we need to tailor Prince2 or Prince2 Agile

291
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,900
to work properly for
this particular project

292
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,000
in this particular environment.

293
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,710
When I look at the Cynefin framework,

294
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,509
it has five key areas.

295
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:18,477
These are obvious, complicated,

296
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:21,532
complex, chaotic, and disorder.

297
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,560
You can see it here on the screen,

298
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
as it's in this graphic.

299
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,250
And when you look at these different

300
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,346
areas, some of these are
going to be more used

301
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:30,753
in projects, and some
are going to be more used

302
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,670
in business as usual.

303
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,417
For example, if I look at obvious,

304
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,504
this is where we have best practices.

305
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:40,020
This is going to be our typical
business as usual operations.

306
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,350
It's very proceduralized it's very easy,

307
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,482
and it is not complex and
it's not uncertain at all.

308
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:48,355
Now as we start moving into
complicated or complex,

309
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:50,141
this is where the environment
or the project itself,

310
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:53,870
becomes more difficult or more uncertain.

311
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,270
This is where most of your
projects are going to be.

312
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,690
We still have good practices,

313
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,210
or emergent practices inside these areas,

314
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,860
that we can work a project with our

315
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,460
existing processes.

316
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,014
Now as we go down into chaotic,

317
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:08,100
this is some novel new
practices just being tried out.

318
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,110
This is something that may be a

319
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,930
first time ever for our company.

320
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,350
So it's very uncertain
and so we're going to have

321
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,570
additional governance
controls placed on that.

322
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,370
If we get into the disorder category,

323
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,980
this is where we have
no known relationships.

324
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
Things are just kind
of messy and thrown up,

325
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,960
and your project is likely to fail.

326
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,899
And so as you figure out
where does your project

327
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,573
and your environment fit
in these five categories,

328
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,409
you can figure how best
to put processes around it

329
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,793
to ensure you have a positive outcome.
