1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:02,017
- [Trainer] When we start talking about

2
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:05,006
tailoring the Plans theme
inside of PRINCE2 Agile,

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,536
we have to recognize
that a lot of big changes

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:09,038
aren't really required

5
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:10,559
because we're still going to do planning

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,417
like we did in PRINCE2.

7
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,738
The biggest difference is going
to be the low-level plans.

8
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,847
With Agile, if we're going to be doing it

9
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,264
in a PRINCE2 Agile method,

10
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:21,992
we'll still have an
overarching project plan.

11
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:24,248
This overarching project
plan may be demonstrated

12
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:26,972
as a Gantt chart or some
other method like that,

13
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:28,690
that provides us with formal milestones

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,486
that show us the duration of work

15
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:32,242
that we expect to get done.

16
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:34,066
The big difference, though,
is once we start looking

17
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,794
inside the Stage or the Team level plans.

18
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:40,010
At this point, we're going to
start looking at the low-level

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,999
details that are shown in backlogs.

20
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:44,628
So, it really becomes more
of a matter of the format

21
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,460
of the plans than having
the plans themselves.

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,761
When we look at this, we're
going to be using Agile

23
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:50,832
techniques and approaches.

24
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:53,642
Things like releases and
sprints and burn charts

25
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:56,771
to show how much value or how much product

26
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,606
can be delivered in a
fixed amount of time.

27
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:01,960
Whether that's a two week
sprint or a four week sprint

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,133
or a four week or an eight week release

29
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,253
or whatever we've decided
to do inside of our plan.

30
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:09,544
The big difference here
is that these plans

31
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:12,101
at the low level, will
be much more informal

32
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:15,579
than what we will see in the
normal PRINCE2 Team plan.

33
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,123
Instead we're going to be
looking at that pole method

34
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:19,634
where we're going to have all of the work

35
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,421
that is in the ready state,
be allowed to be chosen from

36
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,432
during the prioritization
of that s1print planning.

37
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,988
Again, that goes back to
our low-level details.

38
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,861
As we look at this from
an Agile perspective,

39
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,741
there's going to be a lot
of emphasis on planning

40
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:35,899
but we're going to be
doing this in this team

41
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,082
and collaboration based method.

42
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:41,673
We're going to rely on empiricism
instead of rationalism.

43
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:44,384
What I mean by that is we're
really focused on what the

44
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,689
output is going to be.

45
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,986
We're going to do our planning
based on what we've seen

46
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:50,242
based on our previous
experiences, as well.

47
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,601
The planning can be based on
features that are going to be put

48
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,715
into the end product.

49
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,463
It's going to be a very team
based collaborative exercise

50
00:01:57,463 --> 00:02:00,967
and we're going to plan at
the last responsible moment.

51
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,400
And what that means is
that we are going to wait

52
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,103
until right before the
sprint to choose the things

53
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:08,347
we're going to work on in the next sprint.

54
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,168
That allows us to have better clarity

55
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:12,644
because there's a
shorter planning horizon.

56
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:14,721
When we do this, we're
going to pick this out

57
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,641
based on a prioritization system.

58
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:19,377
And, some people use a point
system that helps you to

59
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:22,903
estimate what is most important
and what is least important.

60
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,631
Maybe this feature is worth 10 points

61
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,538
and this other feature is worth two points

62
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:29,121
and we're only going to do
100 points worth of stuff

63
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,199
in this sprint.

64
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,770
And, as we start picking
things, we will then put it in

65
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,193
there based on the level of
effort and the amount of time

66
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,201
it will take.

67
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:38,144
When we look at PRINCE2
and we look at Agile,

68
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:40,415
we're always considering
our planning horizon.

69
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:42,320
How far out can we accurately plan?

70
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,626
It's really hard to figure out
what we're going to plan for

71
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,882
in six months or a year from now.

72
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:49,388
But, it's really easy to start
planning what we're going to do

73
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:51,551
tomorrow or what we're
going to do next week

74
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,177
because it's closer to us
and we have more fidelity

75
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,111
into that planning process.

76
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,799
When we look at the Plans
theme, there's some general

77
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,524
guidance that we have to consider.

78
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:04,003
The first is that PRINCE2 does
support any planning style.

79
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,102
It doesn't say it has to
be some long drawn out

80
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:08,348
planning process.

81
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:11,495
We can use a Gantt chart or a
burn down chart or a sprint.

82
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,125
It doesn't really matter.

83
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,202
As long as we're doing planning,
we're still in accordance

84
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:16,848
with the PRINCE2 framework.

85
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:18,779
We also are going to be focused on doing

86
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,186
product based planning.

87
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,416
And, this can be at any plan level.

88
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,549
When we do product based
planning, that happens at a lot

89
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,543
at the team level, especially in Agile,

90
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:29,834
when we start picking specific features

91
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,399
that we're going to roll into
this sprint and this release.

92
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:36,864
But, that also happens at the
team level, the stage level,

93
00:03:36,864 --> 00:03:38,871
and at the project level.

94
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:41,463
Our high-level plans are
developed to continue to support

95
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:44,448
that continued business justification.

96
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,717
We want to make sure that
the product plan is still

97
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,661
proceeding as planned.

98
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,133
In that, we're going to
give them broad timings.

99
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,808
What's the end date that we
expect the final deliverable?

100
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,322
As well as broad costs.

101
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:57,098
How much of a significant expenditure

102
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:00,240
are we going to have to do
to get to the finish line?

103
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,205
When we look at the lower-level plans,

104
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,434
these are going to be used to support

105
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:05,279
the delivery of our product.

106
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,526
To be able to bring things
into that low-level plan,

107
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:10,800
we are going to do, providing
ready stories and pulling those

108
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,968
into our sprint planning
based on the ready backlog.

109
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,997
We're also going to
provide clearer priorities

110
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:17,568
to the planning team.

111
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:19,728
This is a very high priority function.

112
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,626
This is a low priority function.

113
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:24,432
So, when they're planning what
they're going to work on first,

114
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,274
they're going to be taking,
at least, some of those

115
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:28,237
high priority things
and maybe some of those

116
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:29,486
lower priority things,

117
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:33,064
and they will trade things
that bring out a well rounded

118
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,122
and well planned sprint for
them to work on over the next

119
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,212
two to four weeks.

120
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,216
As we look at the levels of plans,

121
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,752
there's really three levels.

122
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:44,859
The big higher level one
is called the Project level

123
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,037
or the Project Plan.

124
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,166
When we look at this big overarching plan,

125
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,208
it is likely to be a lot more formal

126
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,014
because it's being dealt with
at the project manager level

127
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:55,973
and the project board level.

128
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:59,957
This will show stage boundaries,
releases, major produccts,

129
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:02,979
major activities, different
groupings, and dependencies

130
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,997
across the entire project.

131
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:07,995
This is going to give you the
big broad cost and timing.

132
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:10,766
How much is this new website
that we're going to build

133
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,501
going to cost us and how
many weeks, months, or years

134
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,208
is it going to take to develop?

135
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,813
This is going to be
very big and very broad.

136
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:20,281
As we bring it down to the Stage Plan,

137
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,862
we're going to start bringing
it into a smaller timeframe

138
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:24,494
and a smaller cost window.

139
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,869
Then we bring it down to the lowest level

140
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,897
which is the Team level
or the Release Plan.

141
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,760
Both of these, whichever
term you're going to use,

142
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,779
are more likely to be
in the form of a backlog

143
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,736
instead of a written out plan.

144
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,679
This is going to contain
things like your stories,

145
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,200
your priorities, the amount
of work that needs to be done,

146
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,813
and the relative size of
each of those pieces of work.

147
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:47,715
That's going to allow us to do
a good job in sprint planning

148
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,141
to figure out what we'll be
able to do in this cycle.

149
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,983
As we look at these plans,
you can see it graphically,

150
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,247
we have this overarching Project plan

151
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,499
then underneath that,
we have a Stage plan,

152
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,982
then as we get lower,
we have the Release plan

153
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:03,137
which has also got our Team
plan for those two time boxes.

154
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:06,235
This allows us to focus
specifically on what we're going to

155
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,712
work at, at each and every level.

156
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,385
When we go into our sprint planning,

157
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:12,606
we have to have a way of figuring out

158
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,041
which things we're going to
take from the ready bucket

159
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,947
and work on in the sprint because
usually there's going to be

160
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:21,507
more stuff ready than you have
capacity to be able to do.

161
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,693
And, the way we do this is
we're going to use some sort of

162
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,779
Agile estimating technique.

163
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,725
This is going to give
us a relative estimate

164
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:30,038
based upon a system of points.

165
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,158
This will allow us to choose
which things we want to work

166
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:36,182
on first and which ones we're
going to defer to a later sprint.

167
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,077
There's lots of different types out there.

168
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:40,781
One of them is based
on Fibonacci sequences

169
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:45,614
and has a series of numbers
from 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,

170
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,339
and so on.

171
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,835
The reason they use this
is because one will be your

172
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,323
highest priority and the larger numbers

173
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:53,907
will be your lower priority.

174
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,716
This gives you a nice wide distribution

175
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,725
as you try to figure out which priorities

176
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:59,872
are biggest and smallest.

177
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,958
Another way that I've
see commonly seen used

178
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,867
is what we use the T-shirt size method.

179
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,902
This will be small,
medium, large, extra-large,

180
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:08,176
that kind of an idea.

181
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:10,864
This will allow you to figure
out how much work is involved

182
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,037
in this particular feature.

183
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,435
And, the final way, is
what's known as story points.

184
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,824
This is where the user stories are graded

185
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:20,678
based on some rubric and each
one is assigned a number.

186
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:23,318
Based on those numbers,
we would then prioritize

187
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,682
which one's highest, take more work.

188
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,793
Which one's lowest, take
the least amount of work.

189
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:30,147
Once we've chosen everything
we want to work on

190
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:32,534
for this sprint and put
it into that Sprint plan,

191
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,502
that Team plan, or that Release plan,

192
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:37,263
we are going to move on
into the Progress theme.
