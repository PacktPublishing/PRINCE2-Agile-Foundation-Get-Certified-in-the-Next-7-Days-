1
00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:03,311
- So up to this point, we've
talked a lot about PRINCE2.

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:04,792
And we talked about the principles,

3
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:07,011
the themes, and the processes.

4
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,545
And then, I started talking about

5
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:11,775
the three main different
types of Agile frameworks.

6
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,840
But we haven't talked much
about how to blend the two yet.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,255
And that's what we're going to
start doing in this lecture.

8
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:19,784
And going throughout
the rest of the course.

9
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,175
So when we talk about
Agile, the way that PRINCE2

10
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:25,583
looks at Agile is as
a family of behaviors,

11
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,472
concepts, frameworks, and techniques.

12
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:30,583
So what does that really mean for us?

13
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,640
Well as we start looking at
PRINCE2, which started out

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,735
as a very firm project
management technique.

15
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:38,160
And now, it's starting to try to implement

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,871
Agile inside of it.

17
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,528
We have to understand how we can do that.

18
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:44,763
When we look at PRINCE2 Agile,

19
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:47,498
they look at Agile as
not the, simply the way,

20
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,988
but it is a way of doing projects.

21
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:53,120
And what I mean by that, is it
all comes down to tailoring.

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,738
PRINCE2 in it's purest
form allows for tailoring,

23
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:59,071
because that's the seventh
one of the principles.

24
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,815
And tailoring PRINCE2
really does focus on the

25
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:04,891
project context and what
it's going to affect.

26
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,635
This includes things like how formal

27
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,010
we're going to be in the project.

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,256
Where the emphasis is
placed in the project.

29
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,678
And how we're going to
carry out the project.

30
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,708
And this naturally leads itself,

31
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,630
to implementing well with Agile.

32
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,244
And so, when start looking
at Agile and these different

33
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,893
behaviors, concepts, and techniques.

34
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:22,165
We have to start looking

35
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,424
at the way that we do Agile working.

36
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,070
And how this is going to be different,

37
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,384
to the way we would do Agile,

38
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:29,285
in one of the pure Agile frameworks.

39
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:32,905
Something like Scrum, or
Kanban, or Lean startup.

40
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:34,538
And so, as we start looking at that,

41
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:37,191
we first have to look
at our Agile behaviors.

42
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,942
These behaviors can also be known

43
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:42,458
as our principles, our
values, or our mindset.

44
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,942
Some examples of these
behaviors are things like

45
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:46,429
being collaborative,

46
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:48,055
being self organizing,

47
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,774
being customer focused,

48
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,536
empowering your team members,

49
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:55,141
and trusting your team
members and not blaming them.

50
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:58,301
By really taking these concepts at heart,

51
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:01,294
PRINCE2 Agile really
does focus on making sure

52
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:03,804
we can do the best job in our projects,

53
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:06,991
by using collaborative,
self-organizing teams,

54
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,273
delivering products
that the customer wants,

55
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:11,870
and empowering our team
members to make decisions,

56
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,409
and trusting them to do the right thing.

57
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,998
That's what we're looking
at when we start talking

58
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,730
about these behaviors.

59
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,150
Now, as we start looking forward

60
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,692
and we look at that in PRINCE2,

61
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:24,665
there is five key areas
that we really focus on.

62
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,494
And this is transparency, collaboration,

63
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:31,494
rich communication,
self-organization, and exploration.

64
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,462
These are the Agile
behaviors inside of PRINCE2.

65
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:37,206
So we talk about transparency,

66
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,190
this is focused on being open,

67
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,246
visible, honest, trusting people,

68
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,126
having integrity, and having respect

69
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,702
amongst the team and amongst
your fellow co-workers.

70
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,929
By having this transparency, we all know

71
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,331
where we are in the project,

72
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:53,134
we all know what needs to
get done in the project,

73
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,350
and we can all work
together to get it done.

74
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,807
Which brings us to collaboration.

75
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,294
Collaboration is this
internal collaboration

76
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:03,004
amongst our team where
they work well together.

77
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:05,758
But we also have collaboration externally,

78
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:07,823
between the team and the customers.

79
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:09,657
To make sure we have a
shared understanding of

80
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,258
what needs to be delivered

81
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,293
and who's responsible for what.

82
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,582
Where does that ownership really occur?

83
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:17,334
Now, to make all of this happen and

84
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,151
to have transparency and collaboration,

85
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,250
you have to have rich communication.

86
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,101
And when we talk about
communication in Agile,

87
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,487
we really want to do as much communication

88
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,638
face to face as possible.

89
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:31,856
Because, while email is good
and phone calls are okay,

90
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:34,472
when you have a face to face
communication with somebody,

91
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:37,446
you really do knock down all of the walls.

92
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,542
And you eliminate anything
that might be hidden.

93
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,742
And so everything becomes
fully transparent.

94
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:45,166
It allows communication to
occur quickly and to the point.

95
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,735
And it really does help
progress to move forward.

96
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:50,719
Next, we have self-organization.

97
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,550
When we have these teams, we
want to be able to trust them.

98
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,544
And trust the people in
the teams, so that they

99
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:58,534
can take action and get things done.

100
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:01,387
Allowing self-organization
of the teams to happen,

101
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,726
this inherently is going to

102
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,754
build more trust within the team.

103
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,942
Because, if I'm picking people on my team

104
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,458
that I like to work with,

105
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,094
I'm inherently going to trust them more.

106
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:13,415
So that's really going to
help with all of the other

107
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:14,659
things that we already talked about.

108
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,054
And really getting more progress
done, inside of a project.

109
00:04:17,054 --> 00:04:19,478
And the fifth one that we look at

110
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:21,151
with Agile behaviors is exploration.

111
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,847
Again we talked about this back in Kanban

112
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,317
and we talked about this in Lean startup.

113
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,357
We want to do frequent
iterations with rapid feedback.

114
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:31,298
So that we can get an
opportunity to learn,

115
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,745
so we want to experiment
and create spikes.

116
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:36,339
Put something out there
and see what happens.

117
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:39,336
That is going to be something
that we really do focus on

118
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,241
as one of these principle, or behaviors,

119
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,991
or values inside of Agile
in a PRINCE2 environment.

120
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,852
Now, as we move forward
we start to talk about

121
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,847
the concepts inside of PRINCE2.

122
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,764
Now we look at concepts
from an Agile prospective,

123
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:54,270
these would be known as our fundamentals.

124
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,300
What are some of the fundamentals
that we start considering?

125
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,183
Well we want to think about

126
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:00,427
how we prioritize what
is going to be delivered.

127
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,452
We start realizing that
the customer doesn't

128
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,775
need to have everything.

129
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,580
They need to have the important things.

130
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,021
And so, prioritization is going to be key

131
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:10,284
as we start working and
planning our sprints.

132
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:11,841
We have to work iteratively

133
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:14,004
and we have to increment frequently.

134
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,644
And so again that Lean startup concept of

135
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:18,611
build and learn is going to
be important for us, right?

136
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,620
Build, measure, learn.

137
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,949
And then we're going to have,
not delivering everything

138
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,136
that's asked for.

139
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:26,100
This is a key concept inside of Agile.

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,709
When we look at PRINCE2,
from a structure perspective,

141
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,476
in the older PRINCE2,

142
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,236
the Non-Agile environment.

143
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,812
It really is focused on requirements.

144
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:36,771
At the beginning of
project, we list everything

145
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,656
that this thing needs to have.

146
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:39,791
And at the end of the project,

147
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,516
it has to have all of those things,

148
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:44,152
otherwise we have exceptions
and changes that have to go in.

149
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,277
But with Agile, we understand that

150
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:48,312
we don't know everything upfront.

151
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:52,064
Instead, we put a list of all
the things we think we want.

152
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:53,280
And then we're going to prioritize

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,171
as we go through the project.

154
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,155
The other thing in Agile that
we look at, is time focused.

155
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:59,206
And we talk about this in Timeboxing.

156
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,278
We're going to have strict sets of time,

157
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,421
that is set aside to build
these phases of the project.

158
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,189
We're also going to inspect
and adapt things as they go.

159
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,568
And again, if we inspect it
and we don't find what we like,

160
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,658
we iterate it and we
start working on it again.

161
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:16,143
We have this idea of
continuous improvement,

162
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,460
known as Kaizen in Japanese.

163
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,748
And this is really important
inside of Agile as well,

164
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,280
because we're always trying
to get the next thing.

165
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,540
And get it better, and quicker,

166
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,420
and faster, and cheaper, right?

167
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,616
And that continuous
improvement of our processes

168
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:30,612
allows us to do that.

169
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,605
And then, taking in from
Kanban, we limiting our

170
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,444
work in progress.

171
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:38,305
This is another thing, it is
a key concept inside of Agile

172
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:39,948
that we have to consider.

173
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,660
Now, we've talked about behaviors,

174
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,974
we've talked about concepts.

175
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:44,560
The third part with techniques.

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,334
These are known as the practices,

177
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:47,877
or the tools we're going to use.

178
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,964
And things in this area are things like

179
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,781
burn charts that will
measure our progress,

180
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:54,316
we'll talk about those
more in the progress theme.

181
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:57,382
User stories, which take the
place of our requirements.

182
00:06:57,382 --> 00:07:00,509
Retrospectives, where we
try to learn what happened

183
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,371
during the sprint and
how we can do it better.

184
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:04,756
Timeboxing, where we
give ourselves two weeks

185
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:06,612
or four weeks inside of the sprint.

186
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:08,671
And then measuring flow,
which again is how quickly

187
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:12,125
we can take something from an
idea to a finished product.

188
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,596
And that again comes from
our Kanban perspectives

189
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:18,278
as we measure how things
are moving across.

190
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:20,132
So these are just some of the techniques,

191
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,217
and we'll talk a lot about
them in depth as we go

192
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:24,135
through the rest of this course.

193
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:27,133
Now, when we blend PRINCE2
and Agile together,

194
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:30,987
we do this because it gives
us the best of both worlds.

195
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:33,168
We can do things in a purely Agile method,

196
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,088
but when we do that, we're
very delivery focused.

197
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,287
We're all about getting products out.

198
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,315
And that doesn't give us
a lot of the direction,

199
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,990
and management, and
governance that we might want.

200
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,213
Especially in more
larger complex projects.

201
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:49,140
Now when we look at
PRINCE2, it tends to be

202
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,631
very management driven
and very heavy focused

203
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:53,063
on that governance and control.

204
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,113
But, by blending the two together,

205
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,420
we get the best of both worlds.

206
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,702
We getting the governance,
management, and control

207
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:00,171
from PRINCE2 coming down.

208
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,620
As you can see on the left side here.

209
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,938
And we have Agile
delivery focus coming up.

210
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:06,442
And so we get that area of
strength from both of them

211
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,537
and blend them together.

212
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,973
To give us something that
really does work well

213
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,285
in the real world,

214
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,107
as we start going through our projects.

215
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,995
Instead of using something
that's purely Agile

216
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,164
or purely PRINCE2,

217
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:19,252
we get this PRINCE2 Agile that really does

218
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:20,813
give us the best of both.

219
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,780
So, when I take the best of both,

220
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,401
what do I end up with?

221
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:26,448
Instead of ending up with
the three things from

222
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,238
PRICNCE or the five things from Agile

223
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,491
I end up with eight combined things.

224
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,501
I get the principles, the themes,

225
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,644
and the processes, from PRINCE.

226
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:36,821
Giving me that structure,
that guidance, that management

227
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:39,015
prospective from the top down.

228
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:42,059
But I also get the five
key areas from Agile,

229
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,315
the frameworks, the
behaviors, the concepts,

230
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,094
the techniques, and the focus areas.

231
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:50,668
And by combining all of
this together we really

232
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:54,204
do get a wonderful
package for working in an

233
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,324
Agile method as we move forward.
