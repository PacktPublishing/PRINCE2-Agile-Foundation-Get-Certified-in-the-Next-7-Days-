1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,570
- In any PRINCE2 project, there are

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,880
three main stakeholders that we have

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,080
competing interests with
that have to be balanced.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,320
The first is the business.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,800
The second is the user.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,780
And the third is the supplier.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,020
In a traditional PRINCE2 organization,

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,120
this is represented on the project board

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,679
by the executive, who's
focused on the business needs,

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,560
the senior user, focused
on the user's needs,

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,780
and the senior supplier,

12
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,960
who's focused on the supplier's needs.

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,570
As all three of these are being balanced

14
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,610
inside the project to get
us a product at the end

15
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,200
that meets the delivery requirements

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,740
so the users can get benefit from it.

17
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,390
Now, as we start looking at this

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,350
inside the organization theme,

19
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,250
we have to determine how best
to set up our organization.

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,330
A traditional PRINCE2
organization is set up like this.

21
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,690
We have a project board
with the executive,

22
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,970
senior user, and senior supplier.

23
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,140
Underneath them, we
have a project manager.

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,620
And underneath the project manager,

25
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,350
we have the team manager.

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,640
And then underneath them
is the team members.

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Who are actually working on
the delivery of the product.

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
Now as we look to take this PRINCE2 method

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,330
and start forming it
into an Agile construct,

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,210
we have to look at what
needs to be tailored

31
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,330
inside the organization theme.

32
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,150
The good news is, there
is no major changes

33
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,250
that really have to be made to the way

34
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,390
that PRINCE2 is organized
in order for it to work

35
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,720
in an Agile construct.

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,830
But we do have to add
a couple of key roles.

37
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,370
This is things like looking at the way

38
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,030
the team manager's role is set up,

39
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,170
and figuring out, are they
going to be integrated

40
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,150
into the delivery team,
or are they going to stay

41
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,640
outside of the delivery team

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,650
and be more of a managerial function?

43
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,515
We also need to look at
some common Agile roles,

44
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:37,240
like the product donor
and the scrum master.

45
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,480
When we look at the product donor,

46
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,170
who's going to fulfill that role?

47
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,110
Is it going to be the senior user?

48
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,550
And that's usually the most
common way of doing it.

49
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,970
If not, you're going to have to figure out

50
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,910
who's going to be that
person who's going to act

51
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,360
as the product owner
from an Agile perspective

52
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,690
based on the amount of time
and responsibility they have.

53
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,740
Next, we have to look at the scrum master.

54
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,060
This is something we need to bring in

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,860
if we're going to be using Agile construct

56
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,420
to make sure that somebody
is there making sure

57
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,790
the processes are working properly.

58
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,880
This person is going to
have a direct liaison

59
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,550
with the project manager
or, in some cases,

60
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,330
it may be the project manager.

61
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,301
It just depends on how you
want to set up your project

62
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,100
for your organization.

63
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,477
Now, as we look into the project

64
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,180
and we look at the way the organization

65
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,430
is being set up, we have
to think about the way

66
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,170
the team is going to be designed.

67
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,983
Now, how are we going to design this team?

68
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:25,280
Well, if we're using an Agile construct,

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,624
we should be using self-organizing teams.

70
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:30,320
That delivery team should
be made up of the people

71
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,590
who have the right skills and capability

72
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,720
and mesh together well to
provide the right product.

73
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,821
As we start focusing on
self-organizing teams

74
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:40,350
and allowing them to manage by exception,

75
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,600
we also have to think about
the traditional PRINCE2 roles,

76
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,700
things like project
managers and team managers,

77
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
and how do they fit in.

78
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,840
Well, if we're going to move from PRINCE2

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,270
to PRINCE2 Agile, those two roles

80
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,980
actually have less prominence.

81
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,750
There's less focus on the
managers and more focus

82
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,283
on the delivery itself.

83
00:02:57,283 --> 00:03:00,290
Also, in a traditional
PRINCE2 environment,

84
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,280
we may have some roles out there
like requirements engineers

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,380
or business analysts, who help to develop

86
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,200
the really in-depth
requirements for our project.

87
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,340
When we start dealing with Agile, though,

88
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,490
we don't really need those people,

89
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,230
because we hae our user stories,

90
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,821
and we have our users
getting a lot more integrated

91
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,504
into our delivery and being
represented on the team.

92
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:21,350
And so a lot of that will
actually be diminished

93
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,190
and have less prominence as well.

94
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,810
Doesn't mean they go away completely,

95
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,810
but it does mean we're going
to spend a lot less time

96
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,403
on those particular functions.

97
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:31,280
Now as we start looking at this Agile view

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,600
of the way things are working,

99
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,140
we have to think about
what the relationships are

100
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,380
with different people.

101
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,350
So if we look, for instance, at the PM,

102
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,520
the project manager, and
the TM, the team manager,

103
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,490
how are they going to
relate to each other?

104
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,500
In a traditional PRINCE2 method,

105
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,030
usually the team manager
works for the project manager.

106
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,690
But, inside an Agile
methodology, there's more

107
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,338
of this servant leadership
attitude from the project manager

108
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,060
to the team manager.

109
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,870
While the team manger
still technically works

110
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,890
for the project manager,
the project manager

111
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,810
is really there to help
serve and do the things

112
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,100
that are needed for the team
manger to be successful.

113
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Now, when we start looking
at the team manager themself,

114
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,680
we have a question of should they be

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,220
a part of the delivery
team, or should they just be

116
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,920
managing the delivery team.

117
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,260
And that's going to be different depending

118
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,660
on how you want to do
it inside your project.

119
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,440
We'll talk a little bit more
about that in just a second.

120
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,700
We also have to look at
that senior user role.

121
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,760
Are they going to act as the
product owner and the manager,

122
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,080
or are we going to get somebody
else to fulfill that function?

123
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,283
And then, whatever these changes are

124
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:33,060
that we decide on, because
we're using PRINCE2,

125
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,020
we do need to define those inside

126
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,200
our project initiation documentation,

127
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,620
because that's where the
organization is laid out.

128
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,500
Any changes or tailoring that's being made

129
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,180
should be put into your PID,

130
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,240
your project initiation documentation.

131
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,300
Now, when we look at things
from an Agile perspective,

132
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,098
what adjustments are we
making to the Agile process

133
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:52,200
to make it work well inside PRINCE2?

134
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,270
Well, one of them is that

135
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,800
we only use a single product owner.

136
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,060
Now, again, this can be your senior user,

137
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,870
or it could be delegated elsewhere,

138
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,730
but there should only be one product owner

139
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,390
inside of PRINCE2 Agile.

140
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,270
In a traditional Agile
environment, though,

141
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,340
you can have multiple product owners.

142
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,750
And that's okay, it just depends

143
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,220
on how you want to set it up.

144
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,690
Again, though, it is recommended

145
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,280
to have single product owner
inside of PRINCE 2 Agile,

146
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,900
because it allows more of that control

147
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,680
and governance to occur.

148
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,470
PRINCE2 Agile also
recommends that you have

149
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,380
further roles added to
help that product owner,

150
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,620
people that are known as
subject matter experts,

151
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,390
or user representatives,
and by embedding those type

152
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,380
of people inside the delivery team,

153
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,120
it allows that product owner function

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,082
to remain up at the senior user level.

155
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,420
Also, any of these changes you do,

156
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,870
and any of these modifications
you do inside Agile,

157
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,430
you should define them inside
your working agreements,

158
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,020
because a lot of times, the
teams that are delivering

159
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,240
your product don't work inside

160
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,500
your traditional organization or business.

161
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,640
They might be outsourced or contracted,

162
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,600
and so you want to make
sure all of this is defined

163
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,150
in the proper working agreements

164
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,830
so everybody knows what is expected.

165
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,120
Now, as far as the delivery team goes,

166
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,470
the delivery team has
a lot of people in it,

167
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,990
and we want to make
sure we keep that number

168
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,219
to a reasonable size, usually no more than

169
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:05,380
five to seven people.

170
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,040
We want to make sure
we have representation

171
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,030
from several different places, though.

172
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,018
For example, we need
somebody to lead the team,

173
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,240
usually your team manger.

174
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,920
We need somebody from the customer side,

175
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,150
or their representative.

176
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,650
That could be a subject matter expert

177
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,310
or a user representative.

178
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,420
We need a team to actually
create the products,

179
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,496
and the people who are going to
do the coding and the design.

180
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,220
We also need somebody to ensure

181
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,460
that the quality of the
product meets what we need,

182
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,340
that quality control function.

183
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,890
We need somebody who can coach the team

184
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,578
on how to use Agile, somebody
like our scrum master.

185
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:37,560
And we also need multi-skilled,
generalizing specialists.

186
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,810
That means that we don't want somebody

187
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,750
who can only do one thing.

188
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,980
We need people who can do multiple things.

189
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,560
If I'm going to build
an app, for instance,

190
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,770
I need to have some people
who can do graphic work,

191
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,720
and I need people who can do coding work.

192
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
But if I have somebody who
can only do a very specialized

193
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,690
type of coding, that's not
going to be good enough

194
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,350
for us to be able to be agile enough

195
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,780
to meet the different requirements

196
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,000
that may be placed on our team.

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,960
And so we want to have
people who are kind of

198
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,320
the jack of all trades but master of none.

199
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,860
That kind of philosophy where they can do

200
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,950
a little bit of everything,

201
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,490
and then pull in specialists as needed.

202
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,150
So I know I just threw a
whole bunch of terms at you.

203
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,900
Let's look at how this
looks in a graphical format

204
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,858
as we move from a PRINCE2 format

205
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:17,460
over into a PRINCE2 Agile format.

206
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,860
You'll notice on the left, we have our

207
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,660
traditional PRINCE2 methodology.

208
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,940
This has our project
board with our executive,

209
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,830
senior user, and senior supplier,

210
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,810
and it's hierarchically down
through the project manager,

211
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,720
through the team manager,

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,356
and then down to the team members.

213
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:33,430
Now if we move on to the
right in this Agile linkage,

214
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,340
we're going to look at
how we do this here.

215
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
We still have a project board at the top,

216
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,610
which is our senior user,
our senior supplier,

217
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,730
and our executive.

218
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,330
We still have our project
manager and our team manager,

219
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,070
and they may be one and the same person,

220
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,760
as you see with that line there.

221
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,879
But they're also going
to be working directly

222
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,798
with the delivery team,
and that delivery team

223
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:54,010
is going to be your supplier
subject matter expert,

224
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,050
your customer subject matter expert,

225
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,830
your quality assurance people,

226
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,960
your SMEs, your scrum
masters, all of those people

227
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,780
are part of this delivery team

228
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,110
that helps the organization move properly.

229
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,279
Because they're in the
team, that team becomes

230
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,720
very flat as an organization,

231
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,900
and they all work together collaboratively

232
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,280
to get what we need done,

233
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,860
as opposed to the more
hierarchal nature on the left

234
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,700
when we start dealing
with PRINCE2 hierarchies

235
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,860
in our normal organizations.

236
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,630
So as we continue moving
through our organization theme,

237
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,230
let me give you some guidance

238
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,436
of how we know when we
need to modify things

239
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,320
for this Agile method.

240
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,555
First, we need to add those PRINCE2 roles

241
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,120
to the Agile delivery
roles, and that seems to be

242
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,458
fairly straight-forward, where we can say

243
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,110
the team manger is also
the project manager,

244
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,740
or the project manager
is also the scrum master.

245
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,180
We might have the senior user being

246
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,400
the product owner, right?

247
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,350
Those things line up fairly easily.

248
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,060
How easy this is is going to depend

249
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,140
on the nature of your
work and your project.

250
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,120
Smaller projects are easier to align

251
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,440
than bigger projects, but
we do need to make sure

252
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,056
that we align these roles,
so that we're covering both

253
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:58,030
the PRINCE2 side of things
and the Agile way of working.

254
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,359
If we're looking at routine work,

255
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:02,250
these are going to be very
small-scale routine projects,

256
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,060
the number of teams you
need is probably one,

257
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,090
and this is not applicable
to a PRINCE2 environment,

258
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,376
because it's handled as business as usual.

259
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:10,830
If we look at something that's
a difficult type of work,

260
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,797
but is a small-scale, we still
might only need one team,

261
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:15,490
and this will be pretty straight-forward.

262
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,310
The project manager and
the team manger roles

263
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,570
can be combined into one,
and they might even be part

264
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,070
of that delivery team.

265
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,070
On the other hand, if we have a large

266
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,740
or difficult problem
that we're dealing with

267
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,913
inside the project, we may
need many different teams

268
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,150
to help us work on it.

269
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,152
And if we do that, this is
going to require more care,

270
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:34,210
more governance, and more control.

271
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,953
This is when we're going to
make sure the Agile roles

272
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,676
are properly aligned
to those PRINCE2 roles,

273
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:41,850
even across multiple
teams, and the alignment

274
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,434
may not be as obvious as it would be

275
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:46,079
in a smaller, less difficult project.

276
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,400
Now, the last thing we're going to cover

277
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,180
inside the organization theme
is how we're going to deal

278
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,290
with the project manager relationship

279
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,538
with the delivery team.

280
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:56,700
Is the project manager
going to work directly

281
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,980
with the delivery team?

282
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,730
Are they going to work
with a team manager?

283
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,580
And if so, is that team manager

284
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,030
a part of the delivery team,

285
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,580
or are they going to be management
above the delivery team?

286
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,500
There's really three
ways of looking at it,

287
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,830
and there is no right answer,

288
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,730
because it all depends on
your particular project.

289
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,030
Now, the first way we can do it,

290
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,900
is we can leave the delivery team roles

291
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,570
as they are in Agile, and
they're just going to work

292
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,800
directly with the project manager,

293
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,740
and it's going to be a very ad
hoc, very informal relationship.

294
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,620
The second way, is we can
leave the delivery teams alone,

295
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,540
but we can identify one person on the team

296
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,260
who's going to be the point of
contact for the project manager.

297
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,180
They're going to be the one
who's passing information

298
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,620
to and from the project manager,

299
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,640
and acting somewhat as a team manager.

300
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,230
The third is to actually
create a team manager role

301
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,670
in the delivery team,
and this person will then

302
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,630
manage and oversee the
entire delivery team.

303
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,210
Now, the challenge with
this versus option two,

304
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,200
is that this person now
may be seen as the boss,

305
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,770
and be a little less collaborative

306
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,117
inside that delivery team.

307
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,400
Now when we look at this organizationally,

308
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,310
there is really two ways that we can place

309
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,390
that team manager.

310
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,110
As I said, one is they can kind of work

311
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,960
above the team as a manager,

312
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,950
and the other is that
they can work in the team

313
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,311
as part of team delivery.

314
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,230
If they're working above the team,

315
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,050
this looks more like a
traditional PRINCE2 team.

316
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,135
And it is not as Agile in nature.

317
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,520
Instead, it's better to
get that team manager

318
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,170
to be somebody within the team,

319
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,280
who works on the development as well,

320
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,200
because this is going to
allow you to be more Agile

321
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,490
in the way you work.

322
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,150
So as we look at that, let's assume

323
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,870
that we're going to place our
team manager within the team.

324
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,550
Now, if they're working within the team,

325
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,210
we now have to look at the relationship

326
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,970
between the team manager
and the project manager.

327
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,980
The first way is if you're
using a single team structure.

328
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,375
When you're using a single team structure,

329
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,530
you're going to have a team
manager who's part of your team

330
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,234
reporting directly to a project manager,

331
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,873
and that person is going to
report to the project board.

332
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:47,060
Now, that project manager and team manager

333
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,100
may also be the same
person if you're dealing

334
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,691
with a small-scale project.

335
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:54,240
Now, if our project is
more complex and difficult,

336
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,810
and we have more teams,
say this example here,

337
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,554
where I have three
different delivery teams,

338
00:11:58,554 --> 00:12:00,880
then I would have a team manager in charge

339
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,373
of each of the three teams.

340
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:05,240
Each of those delivery
managers or team managers

341
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,912
would report up to the project manager.

342
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:09,400
From that point on, it becomes much more

343
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,450
like standard PRINCE2, with
lots of governance and control

344
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,220
at the project manager and
the project board levels,

345
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,190
but remaining very Agile
down at the delivery level,

346
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,380
with the team managers
and the delivery teams

347
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,363
running the show.
