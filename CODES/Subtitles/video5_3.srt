1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,043
- [Jason] Our first theme
is the business case,

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:04,635
and the first thing we
have to do inside the

3
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:07,937
business case is define what value is.

4
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:10,829
Value is the benefits that
are delivered in proportion

5
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,893
to the resources that we put into it.

6
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,630
So if I'm going to put in
a $1,000,000 of company

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,010
assets, I'm hoping that
I'm going to get at

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,870
least a $1,000,000 back out.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,509
That would be a positive
evaluation and a positive return

10
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,845
on our investment inside this project.

11
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,261
Now, the problem is when we look at

12
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,747
value, it's not always so clean.

13
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:31,458
It's not $1 in equals $2 out.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,520
Often, it's going to be subjective.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,283
Maybe I'm going to spend
$10,000 on an ad campaign,

16
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:38,258
so you know who I am and you start

17
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:40,150
knowing me and trusting me more.

18
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,768
That had some subjective outcomes that

19
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:43,489
we're going to have to figure out.

20
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:44,905
So when you do this, it's often

21
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:47,228
easier just to assign relative values.

22
00:00:47,228 --> 00:00:50,528
Maybe something like small,
medium, or big, right?

23
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:53,338
That would be the relative
value, as opposed to saying

24
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:55,852
that if I put $10,000
into this ad campaign,

25
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:58,852
I'm going to get back $16,243 in value.

26
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:03,004
Maybe I would just say I'm
going to get back medium value.

27
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,850
And so, these values can be
assessed in many, many ways.

28
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,023
If you look at value, it may be

29
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:09,756
tied directly to your revenue.

30
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,747
It may be that I put in $10,000

31
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:14,256
and get back $20,000 in profit.

32
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,885
It may be that I've reduced cost.

33
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:19,520
I spent $10,000 on
building this new IT system

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,500
that's going to reduce my
manpower requirements, and that's

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,346
going to save us money every
single month moving forward.

36
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:28,740
Or, value may even be something
like customer satisfaction.

37
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,642
It may cost me money to
provide a better customer

38
00:01:31,642 --> 00:01:34,753
experience, but that
customer satisfaction may be

39
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:37,407
worth it in the end and be
of more value to us than

40
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,759
the actual revenue or reducing cost.

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,007
And so it really does depend
on what your end goals

42
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:43,994
are for your particular project.

43
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:47,095
The idea here is we want to
focus on the benefits, and

44
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:49,993
these benefits are going to be
helped through collaboration.

45
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,419
We want to get a benefit that's comes from

46
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,502
an outcome that comes from an output.

47
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:54,742
Now, what does that mean?

48
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:57,014
Well, if I start doing some process,

49
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:59,502
and building some thing, that's an output.

50
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:03,158
That output enables our
customer to get the outcome

51
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:06,262
they want, and that outcome
can then turn into a benefit.

52
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:09,009
If I'm going to create a
new process in a new piece

53
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,626
of software that's going
to more quickly filter

54
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:14,004
through your emails, that's an output.

55
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,507
When you take that and
you put it into practice,

56
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,147
you're trying to achieve
an outcome, saving yourself

57
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,004
time going through your inbox.

58
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:23,248
Now, if it does do that,
you're going to realize

59
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,657
that, as a benefit, you've saved 3 hours

60
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,545
per day of going through emails.

61
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,247
That's how we take our output,
move it into an outcome,

62
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,370
and then, ultimately,
get that benefit, which

63
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,706
is what we derive our value from.

64
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,767
Now, as we look forward
and we start looking

65
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,758
at how we're going to
tailor the business case,

66
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,150
there's not any major
changes in the business case

67
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,779
that are required, because
the business case is something

68
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:46,939
that's fairly universal in
traditional Waterfall Development

69
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,986
as well as an Agile Development.

70
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,644
The only real thing
here is that we're going

71
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:53,125
to need more information on tolerances

72
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,237
around what the intended benefit is.

73
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,273
And what I mean by that is,
if I'm building a piece of

74
00:02:57,273 --> 00:03:01,506
software to save you 3 hours a
day by filtering your emails,

75
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:03,503
then I'm going to have to
build intolerances as they're

76
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,953
building the project of
what features are needed

77
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:09,025
and how well those features need to work.

78
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,747
Another thing that we're
going to tailor inside the

79
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:13,473
business case is the
realization that we're trying to

80
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,824
get early benefits by
applying early costs.

81
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:18,764
And what I mean by that is
we want to develop something

82
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,491
like a minimum viable product.

83
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,764
I want to get you some
incremental delivery.

84
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:25,881
If I can get you version 1 of
my email filtering software,

85
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,755
and you could start using
it, and you realize that it's

86
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:30,237
only giving you an
hour-and-a-half savings per day,

87
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,747
then you can recommend some
tweaks and give me some

88
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:35,505
feedback that I can implement
into version 2, and by

89
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:37,758
doing this incremental
delivery, giving you a little

90
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:40,000
bit and a little bit and a
little bit, we could start

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,939
getting feedback quicker and adjust it to

92
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,610
give us a better valuation and benefit.

93
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,993
Lastly, Agile is focused on
getting value from a user story.

94
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:52,524
This is where it says "I
am this person and I want

95
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,977
this thing so that I can do X benefit."

96
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:59,013
This is going to allow for
better feature prioritization

97
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:01,522
when we need to do that,
because a lot of times, our

98
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:04,755
business case may state that
we're going to get end benefit

99
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:06,745
of X but we don't have enough money

100
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,500
to build everything that X needs.

101
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,233
And so we're going to have
to start prioritizing.

102
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,242
What is the most important
thing to the customer?

103
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:13,768
What do they value?

104
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:16,756
And based on that, we'll make
prioritization decisions.

105
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,003
So, how does Agile view the business case?

106
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:23,007
Well, inside of Agile there
are 3 main considerations

107
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:26,012
for the business case, and
the first one may shock you.

108
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:28,001
It's that in some Agile environments,

109
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,026
you may not need a business case at all.

110
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:33,364
Instead, they would replace
that with user stories or the

111
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:36,508
intended value and benefits
that we're trying to achieve.

112
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,255
It would be a very very summarized version

113
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,379
of a business case essentially,
because it's going to leave

114
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,098
out all of the formality
and all of the details.

115
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,416
The second thing we have
to remember is that there's

116
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,239
often a focus on value
assigned to features

117
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,737
instead of an end result or an output.

118
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,151
So again, this is what features are

119
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,166
important to our customer;
where do they derive value from?

120
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,237
And so, if there's features
that are important to them,

121
00:04:58,237 --> 00:04:59,070
that's something that we're going to have

122
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,267
to build into that business case.

123
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,438
And finally, we have to
remember that the business case,

124
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,998
or this user stories, or
whatever we're developing instead

125
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:09,000
of a business case, it has to be created

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,859
at the beginning of our project.

127
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,756
This would be back in
what we would refer to as

128
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:16,290
the Starting Up A Project
Phase in Traditional Prince 2.

129
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,643
In an Agile environment though
we may call this Sprint Zero.

130
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:21,373
Sprint Zero is where
we're doing all the prep

131
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,191
work before moving into the first

132
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:25,756
Sprint where we actually start work.

133
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:28,257
So in summary, let me provide
you some guidance on the

134
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:32,007
business case, as it implies
inside of an Agile environment.

135
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,491
First, the business case may be affected

136
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,631
by the amount of things being delivered.

137
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:39,263
So, if we have a very
large product backlog,

138
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:41,237
that's going to have a lot of
different features that have

139
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:43,411
to be prioritized and
figured into it, and the

140
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,356
business case is going
to be affected by that.

141
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:47,632
If we have a very small
list of features, and things

142
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:50,549
we want to deliver, then we may
not even use a business case,

143
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,042
but instead just use the user stories.

144
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,418
Second, early delivery of benefits is

145
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:57,245
going to affect our business case.

146
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:59,665
If I develop a minimum viable
product and I start getting

147
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,780
that to customers, and they
start using it, and they

148
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,507
realize it's great, that's
good for our business case,

149
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,757
but they start using it and
realize that it's horrible,

150
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,267
that may mean that we're
going to abandon this project.

151
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,466
And because of this, you
really needed to find in your

152
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,509
business case what is going to
be your minimum viable product?

153
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,043
What is the minimum thing
you have to deliver that's

154
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,655
going to give the benefit to
the customer they're expecting?

155
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,342
Your project viability is not the

156
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:23,740
same as your minimum
viable product either.

157
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,610
Minimum viable product is the
least amount of product you

158
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,504
need to deliver, but the
project viability is based

159
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:32,260
on whether it's going to be
received well based on what

160
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,997
value is going to be gotten
out of this project, and the

161
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,265
minimum viable product is only version 1.

162
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,831
We're going to reiterate
and do incremental

163
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,002
development of that as
we keep moving forward.

164
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,746
So project viability must go
past the minimum viable product

165
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,761
for us to be able to get
to version 2 and version 3.

166
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,007
We also needed to find
inside of this business case

167
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:54,392
what is our best-case,
worst-case, and expected-case in

168
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,004
relation to the amount of
features we're going to deliver?

169
00:06:57,004 --> 00:07:00,509
Best-case is I give a customer
100% of what they asked for.

170
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:03,002
Worst-case is probably half of that.

171
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:06,151
Expected-case, probably
somewhere in the 70-80% range,

172
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,738
because again, our customer
doesn't have to get delivered

173
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,379
everything they want, but we do

174
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,772
need to know what's the worst-case?

175
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:12,963
What are the minimum things that

176
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:15,406
they need to have a viable product?

177
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:17,506
And the final guidance
is that high uncertainty

178
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:20,456
leads to more minimal business cases.

179
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,407
If I'm going to do something
that's brand new that we've

180
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:25,467
never done before, we need
to just start getting into it

181
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,492
and start testing our assumptions quickly.

182
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,751
If it's something that's more
certain, and it's something

183
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,000
that's a bigger project, for
example we're building a house

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,262
that's more certain, we know
what the end state needs to

185
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:37,166
look like, then we would have
a well-defined business case,

186
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,626
but often if we're doing things
like software development,

187
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,613
or we're doing things like
putting on a production,

188
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,893
there are things that are
highly uncertain in that.

189
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,111
And because of that, we just need to get

190
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,088
things out there and see what sticks.

191
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,753
It's all about getting those things out

192
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:51,685
and testing those assumptions quickly

193
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:54,073
so that we can move on
into the next phases.
