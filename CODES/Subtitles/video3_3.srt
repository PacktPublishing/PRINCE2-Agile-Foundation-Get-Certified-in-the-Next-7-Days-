1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,830
- What is Scrum?

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,510
Well, Scrum is an Agile
Framework that's used

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:08,200
for developing and
sustaining complex products.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,310
Scrum is a collection of
different roles, events,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,520
artifacts, and rules for us
to be able to make products

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,660
faster and more efficiently.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,100
It was first created back in 1995

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,770
by Schwaber and Sutherland,

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,820
and it was a method that's
used to assess the efficiency

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,060
of your current practices in
order for you to improve them

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,840
so you can get things done
better, cheaper, faster,

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,230
and with less risk,

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,320
and that is what we're
going to heavily base

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,840
our PRINCE2 Agile on
is the Scrum Framework.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,390
Now, Scrum Theory was
founded in empirical process

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,400
control theory.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,560
They wanted to see what was being done

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,580
and make their decisions
based on evidence.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,600
There are three core
areas of Scrum Theory;

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,370
transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,860
Transparency is focused
on showing that there are

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,460
significant aspects of the
process that must be visible

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,230
to all of those who are
responsible for the outcome,

24
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,650
so the old ways of some
manager in an ivory tower

25
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,480
having all of the information,

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,290
and those of us down at lower levels,

27
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,080
not knowing the bigger picture,

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,290
that is gone inside of Scrum.

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,700
Scrum thinks that everyone
from the bottom to the top

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,350
should have transparency
into the significant aspects

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,330
of the process,

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,480
because it allows us to
make better decisions

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,500
and work better as a team.

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,450
The second core area is inspection,

35
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,560
and this is focused on
users frequently inspecting

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,920
the artifacts and the progress
towards your sprint goal,

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,250
because again, focusing on transparency,

38
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,910
if we all know where we are,

39
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,930
and we check the progress as we're going,

40
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,530
we'll all be able to get there better,

41
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,110
faster, and cheaper.

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,200
And the third is adaptation.

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,050
Adaptation is where we focus
on taking our processes

44
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,100
and our materials and
adjusting them as needed.

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,630
Nothing is sacred here,

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,460
everything can be modified.

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,230
Just like we talked about
back in PRINCE2 principles,

48
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,040
where we say we want to
tailor to the environment

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,550
of tailor to the project,

50
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,810
adaptation really does believe that,

51
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,500
and that is one of the heavy concepts

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,093
here inside of Scrum Theory.

53
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,200
Now, when we look at our Scrum team,

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,380
we have to realize that
this team of people

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,860
that are going to work on the project,

56
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,900
they should be self-organizing,

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,900
cross-functional, flexible,
creative, and productive.

58
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,320
By self-organizing,

59
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,040
the team doesn't have to have
this hard amount of pressure

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,120
from management to get things done.

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,760
They're going to come
together and form together

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,270
to get the product done
that needs to be done.

63
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,540
They're cross-functional,

64
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,140
meaning that everything you
need to build the final product

65
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,450
should exist already within the team.

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,900
So if I'm making a website,

67
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,680
that means I need somebody
who can write copy

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,513
for the website,

69
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,500
I need somebody who can build
graphics for the website,

70
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,460
and I need somebody who
can code for the website.

71
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,670
If I have those three people in my team,

72
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,640
and we all self-organize together,

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,590
we're now cross-functional
because we each have

74
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,060
different areas of expertise.

75
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,630
That allows us to be more
flexible, more creative,

76
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,920
and more productive as we move forward,

77
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,460
and that's the whole benefit of Scrum

78
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,790
is putting the right
people on the right teams

79
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,410
so that you can get the
right product at the end.

80
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,080
As we start looking at the Scrum team,

81
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,713
there are different roles
that we're going to have

82
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,260
that have to be assumed.

83
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,100
We have the role of product owner,

84
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,700
development team, and Scrum master.

85
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,780
Now, the Scrum team is actually bigger

86
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,410
than just the development team,

87
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,760
so in the example of the website,

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,210
I said I need a graphic
designer and a coder

89
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,400
and a copy editor,

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,280
well that's the development team.

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,110
They are going to consist
of the professionals

92
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,310
who do the work and deliver
a reasonable increment

93
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,330
of done for each sprint.

94
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,190
They're going to give us some
product that can be released.

95
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,120
But, outside of the development team,

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,030
we have some other roles as well.

97
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,440
We have a product owner.

98
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,730
They're the ones who are
responsible for maximizing

99
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,270
the value of the product
resulting from the work

100
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,420
that the development team is building.

101
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,840
They're going to be the ones
who manage the product backlog

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,830
and create a lot of the requirements,

103
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,500
and so, if you want to
take this product owner,

104
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,320
you could think about
them as the customer,

105
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,090
they're the ones who are asking
for something to be built,

106
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,290
and then we have this third
thing called a Scrum master,

107
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,890
and the Scrum master is a
person who's responsible

108
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,670
for the process of Scrum and making sure

109
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,370
that everyone kind of buys into the idea

110
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,870
that we're going to work as a team,

111
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,480
that we're going to
work cross-functionally,

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,450
and that we're going to work
in this highly adaptable

113
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,953
and fast changing environment.
