1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,170
- Our last theme is Progress,

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,350
and as we consider the progress theme,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,250
the big thing here is that there's no,

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,210
major changes that are
needed to the progress theme.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,200
In fact, both PRINCE2 processes

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,490
and Agile techniques can both be used

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,610
and both have value in
measuring our progress.

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,680
When we start talking about
the Agile techniques though,

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,540
we're going to be focused
a little bit more,

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,220
on what is being delivered,
this includes stuff like

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,610
the velocity, how fast
it's being delivered,

12
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,970
the lead times, how long
does it take from the time

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,530
we initiate to the time
it gets to final delivery.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,760
Or the value that it gives at the end.

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,890
We do this by using Burn Down
charts and Burn Up charts.

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,190
We also do this by demonstrating

17
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,160
the value that's been accrued.

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,020
There's tolerances that are
set early on in our process,

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,310
that support this by giving us the scope

20
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,900
and quality that we can work with.

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,970
And if we're not making enough progress,

22
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,650
we'll go back to the scope and quality

23
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,310
and redo some of those to
make the progress we need,

24
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,570
and get the deliverables out on time.

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,400
Progress is tracked at
all levels of the project,

26
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,670
down at the team level,
up at the stage level,

27
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,540
with the project manager and then up at

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,600
the project level with the project board.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,170
And it's important that we maintain

30
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,390
progress towards our end goal.

31
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,760
Now as we look at progress,
the Agile perception of this

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,471
is that there's a large
emphasis on tracking progress.

33
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,970
PRINCE2 we always tracked
our progress as well,

34
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,180
but not nearly as much as Agile.

35
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,060
Agile is looking for daily updates,

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,410
we want to constantly know where are we at

37
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,610
in building things towards our end goal.

38
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,310
We do this using visualization techniques,

39
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,900
visualization techniques
are things like Burn charts,

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,480
and work in progress
charts, and we put these up

41
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,800
on the information radiator so everybody

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,760
can know exactly where we are.

43
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,450
By making sure there's
transparency in visualizing

44
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,040
and communicating the progress,

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,590
the team can all rally
around getting things done

46
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,790
and making sure we're
making the progress we need.

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,900
Whatever technique you
use, you want to make sure

48
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,060
your team is comfortable with that format.

49
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,930
If you want to use
spreadsheets and numbers,

50
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,970
that's fine if the team's good with it.

51
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,940
If you like charts and graphs instead,

52
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,270
then you should use those,
a lot of times though

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,950
it's a lot easier to use
a visualization technique,

54
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,190
like these charts and graphs I'm

55
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,390
going to show you in this lesson.

56
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,160
The first visualization
technique I want to

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,090
show you is called a Burn Chart.

58
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,650
And there's two types of
Burn Charts that we use,

59
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,180
one is called the Burn Down Charts,

60
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,360
and the other is called the Burn Up Chart.

61
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,020
Both of these are going to
show you the current situation,

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,730
the rate of progress, and
what has been completed.

63
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,270
But there is a difference,
with a Burn Down Chart,

64
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,810
we're going to assume that
there's a fixed amount of work,

65
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,920
with a Burn Up Chart we're going to assume

66
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
that the work amount is likely to

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,220
change even inside of one Spring.

68
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,840
And so as we look at this
Burn Down Chart on the screen,

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,290
you can see that we have two axises,

70
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,720
we have Time, and Effort Remaining.

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,350
And we have this nice straight line,

72
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,090
going from the amount of
effort at the beginning,

73
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,380
being 100%, all the way
down to zero percent,

74
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,260
once we hit our end of
our stage, or that time.

75
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,150
You'll see the jagged black line there,

76
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,670
that's showing the actual
work that has been done,

77
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,780
you'll see that originally,

78
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,550
we weren't meeting enough of the intent.

79
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,090
So we've put in extra work,
we've got back on schedule,

80
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,170
and actually created more effort done,

81
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,570
based on the time of where we wanted,

82
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,410
and now we're back towards the actual

83
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,380
line that we intended to be on.

84
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,730
Now as we move on to the next chart,

85
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,840
you'll see here is a Burn Up Chart.

86
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
A Burn Up Chart, instead
of starting at the top

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,200
and working down, is starting
at the bottom and working up.

88
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,080
The black line is the actual
work that has been produced,

89
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,870
and you can see, over time,
we're going to get up to 100%.

90
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,330
Now as you see, the total
work is that pink line.

91
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,510
And that is going to show
the work, as it starts out,

92
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,660
is fixed but somebody added
more work into this stage.

93
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,750
And so now we have a
higher level to be at.

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,100
But that started being too much,

95
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,360
so we've removed some and
the line came back down,

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,650
and we're constantly
adding and removing work,

97
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,630
until the effort and
the work end up meeting,

98
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,710
at the finish of the stage.

99
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,750
Another visualization technique we have,

100
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,560
is called a Cumulative
Flow Diagram, or CFD.

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,290
A Cumulative Flow Diagram
is used to track the work

102
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,790
and show the amount of work
that's remaining on each day.

103
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,720
So if we look at here on the chart,

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,240
you'll see this work in progress

105
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,470
board coming from our CONBON.

106
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,870
Now as you see we have the day listed,

107
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,390
we have what is ready,
what is being built,

108
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,920
what is being tested,
what is ready to deploy,

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,860
and what has actually been deployed.

110
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,080
And as we look across this, over the days

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,510
and across the columns
we can actually calculate

112
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,630
our lead time, how long does it take

113
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,570
for somebody to go from being
ready to being deployed.

114
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,460
You can look at this through
this chart and figure that out.

115
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,630
Now when we look at this
in a graphical form,

116
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,460
it's a little bit easier to see.

117
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,010
You can see here on day eight,

118
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,750
what was actually shown as ready,

119
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,510
in build, in test, ready
to deploy, and deployed.

120
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,230
And over time, we had a lot more deployed,

121
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,560
and a lot less ready
because we started pulling

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,190
things out inside this sprint
cycle to get that work done.

123
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,550
The last visualization technique
were going to talk about,

124
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,600
is called the Information Radiator.

125
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,150
And the Information
Radiator is a central board,

126
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,180
inside the teams workspace
that has all the information

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,190
on it that you could possibly
want to know about our project.

128
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,580
This is going to be visual
in nature most of the times,

129
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,930
and it's immediately accessible,

130
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,380
and gives you full transparency.

131
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,010
This is best created
and maintained manually,

132
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,760
by people actually writing things out,

133
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,090
and pinning it to a board,
we don't really like

134
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,590
doing this in a digital format,

135
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,290
because a lot of things get
lost in the digital space.

136
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,040
Plus, it's not centrally
seen by everybody,

137
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,030
when it's sitting on somebodies

138
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,420
website or somebodies SharePoint site.

139
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,550
Information here should be
pushed rather than pulled,

140
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,210
that means as the Project
Manager or the Team Manager,

141
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,970
or somebody on the team I
should be putting information

142
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,560
onto the Information Radiator,

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
so that everybody else on the
team can get that information.

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,370
When we hold our daily stand-up meeting,

145
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,960
we should be holding it around
the Information Radiator,

146
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,270
so we all can see a display and update

147
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,610
it immediately, as we're talking about it.

148
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,760
What does one of these
Information Radiators look like?

149
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,430
Well here's an example for you,

150
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,490
you can see on here we
have our team goals,

151
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,490
we have our Burn Charts,
we have what work is to do,

152
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,940
what's in progress, and
what's been deployed.

153
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,290
We have what issues we have,
we have what news we have,

154
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,740
and what our Team Rules are,

155
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,330
and this is just a sample of what kind

156
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,153
of information you can
sitting on your Team Radiator.
