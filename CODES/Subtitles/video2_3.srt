1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,260
- In PRINCE2, the seven
themes are these areas

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,450
of project management
that have to be addressed

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,950
continuously throughout the project.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,370
As we look at these seven themes,

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,880
you're going to see that they are based

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,380
upon the seven principles we just covered.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,070
And next we're going to take these themes

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,840
and apply them by using seven processes,

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,830
because PRINCE2 is all about sevens.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,120
It's the seven principles,
the seven themes,

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,920
and the seven processes.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,100
Now, what are those seven themes?

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,650
The seven themes are
business case, organization,

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,650
quality, plans, risk,
change, and progress.

15
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,920
Now, the first one we're
going to talk about

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,380
is the business case.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,921
What is the business case?

18
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,099
Well, the business case is created

19
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:45,220
and maintained to create
this business justification

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,150
for the project,

21
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,560
and so it really is using that principle

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,980
of continued business justification.

23
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,870
This is going to ensure

24
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,730
that our project's outcomes are achieved

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,268
and the benefits we want
are actually realized.

26
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:57,860
As we go through and we decide

27
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,980
are we going to take
on this project or not,

28
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,050
the first thing we're going to do

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,610
is develop this business case

30
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,800
and decide is it worthwhile?

31
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,020
How much is it going to cost?

32
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,450
How much time is it going to take?

33
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,710
And what are the benefits
we're going to get out of it?

34
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,070
If there's a good balance there

35
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,610
like we talked about in
continued business justification,

36
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,523
then we can initiate the project.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,110
The next thing we have is organization.

38
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,930
An organization is used to define

39
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,140
the project's organizational
structure and the roles.

40
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,760
This is going to use that principle

41
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,080
of defined roles and responsibility.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,830
This is going to help us to
define our communication approach

43
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,400
and how we're going to engage
with different stakeholders,

44
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,620
up from the project board
down into the project manager

45
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,130
across over to our
users and our suppliers.

46
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,100
All of this is stuff that
we're going to have to develop

47
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,388
inside of our organization theme.

48
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:45,300
Next we have quality,

49
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,410
and quality is used to define the project

50
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,240
quality management approach.

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,590
This is what's going to
specify the prioritized

52
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,780
acceptance criteria for our
final project's product,

53
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,530
and by doing this we're going to say,

54
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,160
does this product meet the warranty

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,670
and use case that we're developing it for?

56
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,680
If it does,

57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,560
then we've maintained good quality

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
and it's accepted by our end customer.

59
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,240
We're going to talk about
quality both inside the project

60
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,710
and into its final product state

61
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,020
as we go through this course.

62
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,850
Next we have plans,

63
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,170
and plans is really going

64
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,580
and taking that manage by stages approach

65
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,540
and going into it much,
much more in depth.

66
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,190
Plans are going to be used
to recommend different levels

67
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,470
of planning that's going to be done

68
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,780
to facilitate communication and control

69
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,185
from different perspectives
across the project organization.

70
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,760
These plans are going to
enable our business case

71
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,230
to be realized with a product at the end.

72
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,690
So this is going to take it from idea

73
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,350
all the way through
execution into delivery.

74
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,690
When we break this up into
managing it by stages,

75
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,490
we have an overall plan
called the project plan.

76
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,230
We then have a stage plan
for that particular stage,

77
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,610
and underneath that stage plan,

78
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,690
we may have several team plans

79
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,890
that are being used for
specific pieces of the project,

80
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,983
and all of these are going
to nestle in together

81
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:01,810
so that we can have a good,
cohesive way of managing this

82
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,610
from start all the way through to finish.

83
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,920
The next theme we have is the risk theme,

84
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,580
and risk theme is going
to be focused on defining

85
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,090
the risk management approach

86
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,620
and ensuring that the
project risks are identified,

87
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,100
assessed, and controlled.

88
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,920
And we do this through the
risk management process.

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,740
The risk management process goes through

90
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,100
and does identification,

91
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,370
assessment, planning, implementation,

92
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,300
and communicating those risks
up through the organization.

93
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,812
We'll talk more about that
as we go through the course.

94
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,320
The next thing we have is change.

95
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,350
Change is inevitable in a project,

96
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,040
whether it's a change in requirements,

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,420
a change in deliverables,

98
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,730
a change in personnel,

99
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,510
a change in the way you do business.

100
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,590
Change is always going to happen.

101
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,810
And the change theme
is focused on defining

102
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,360
the change control approach

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,800
and ensuring that issues
are captured, assessed,

104
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,560
and controlled during
all of these changes.

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,490
Because if we can have a
good control over the change,

106
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,800
this is going to allow us to
have a good quality product

107
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,950
at the output.

108
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,190
Now, in Agile,

109
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,050
we're going to modify change a little bit,

110
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,740
but you'll see that as we
go through this course.

111
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,650
Next we have progress,

112
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,600
and progress is about defining the way

113
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,610
that a project's progress is measured

114
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,300
and compared to its performance targets.

115
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,440
This can be done in
lots of different ways.

116
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,110
Some organizations do progress

117
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,636
based on how much money has
been spent towards the goal.

118
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:22,780
Others do it by how much
products have been created

119
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,700
or how much work output has been created.

120
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,120
We'll talk about different
ways inside this course

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,920
as we go through the Agile concepts.

122
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,370
But the whole idea is that
progress is going to enable us

123
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,580
to forecast the continuing
project viability

124
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,110
by figuring out how much
has been done so far

125
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,743
and how much is left to do.
