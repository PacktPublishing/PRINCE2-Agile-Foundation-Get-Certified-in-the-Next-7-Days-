00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,340
- In this section,

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,690
we're going to do a quick review

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,860
of the seven processes from PRINCE2

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,040
and how they're applied inside
of an Agile environment.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,000
As we go through the
next couple of lessons,

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,990
we'll dig into each of these processes

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,290
a little bit more in depth.

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,920
First let's look at the
seven processes that we use

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,577
and how they're laid out
across the different stages.

10
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:21,230
The first one is starting up a project.

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,323
This is where we take all
of the ideas that we have

12
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,140
and come up with the one idea

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,250
that we think is going to be our project.

14
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,420
This gets presented up to
program management and corporate,

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,740
and when they approve it,

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,560
it's going to initiate the project

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,720
and move us into the
project initiation stage.

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,610
Here we're going to be using the
initiating a project process.

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,790
Inside that process,

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,120
we're going to further
develop the business case,

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,680
and we're then going to also develop

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,620
our project initiation document,

23
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,240
which provides our risk management,

24
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,339
communication management,

25
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:52,310
and other structures
that we're going to need

26
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,080
throughout the life cycle of this project.

27
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,480
During this initiating a project process,

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,550
we're also going to develop the stage plan

29
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,840
for the subsequent that we're moving to,

30
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,142
as well as the overarching project plan.

31
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,870
This will then go back
up to directing a project

32
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,160
in that process where the program board

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,870
can make decisions if
they want to move forward

34
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,790
and if we have a continued
justifiable business case

35
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,770
to keep moving the
project towards the right

36
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,358
and towards the finish line.

37
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:19,980
At this point, if we get
to the end of a stage,

38
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,250
we're going to go into our
managing a stage boundary process,

39
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,300
and in this process,

40
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,690
we're going to look
over the next stage plan

41
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,800
to make sure it can be
approved and worked on,

42
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,830
as well as look over
the current stage plan

43
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,100
and ensure that everything
that was supposed to be done

44
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,310
has been completed before
we move to the next stage.

45
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,680
Assuming that stage
boundary has been approved,

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,800
we'll move into the subsequent stages,

47
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,310
and in each of these stages,

48
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,120
you're going to see
that the project manager

49
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,360
is focused on controlling a stage.

50
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,520
This is where they do the day to day work

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,230
that needs to be done for
the project management.

52
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,040
Underneath them, at the same time,

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,270
you're going to see
managing product delivery.

54
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,330
This is focused on the team managers

55
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,640
working with their teams
to create those products

56
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,260
that need to be delivered
to finish the stage.

57
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,980
As that information flows back
up to the project manager,

58
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,850
they will then enter

59
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,620
into the managing a stage
boundary process again,

60
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,490
going back to the directing a project,

61
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,580
and seeing if we can get approval
to move to the next stage.

62
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,140
We'll continue doing this in
all of our subsequent stages

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,940
until we get to the last stage.

64
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
In the last stage,

65
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,690
we'll have this closing a project process

66
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,320
where we ensure that the project has met

67
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,570
all of its deliverables

68
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,570
and that there's nothing more to do.

69
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,510
If that's true,

70
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,450
the directing a project process

71
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,650
will then feed into the
closing a project process

72
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,630
and give them approval to
close out the project fully,

73
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,930
releasing the resources and people

74
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,950
back to their own organizations

75
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,960
and getting ready for the next project.

76
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,540
So all of that that we just covered

77
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,560
is how it works in a
traditional PRINCE2 methodology.

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,130
But how does it work
when we start bringing in

79
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,410
Agile concepts, techniques, and behaviors?

80
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,240
Well, Agile is going to
need to be incorporated

81
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,030
into each of those seven processes,

82
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,260
but the amount of variation
that's going to happen

83
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,425
to that process is going to
depend on the process itself

84
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,550
and the agile techniques
we're going to implement.

85
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,165
For example, if we look
at the controlling a stage

86
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:07,070
or the managing product
delivery processes,

87
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,284
both of those will be heavily changed

88
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:11,360
based on our Agile framework.

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,694
For example, if I have a stage,

90
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,940
this is going to be a certain
amount of time or deliverables

91
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,500
that are going to be existing in there.

92
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,010
Underneath that one stage, though,

93
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,647
we may have several releases,

94
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:24,000
and each of those releases
may have several sprints.

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
So as you can see here on the screen,

96
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,250
we have three sprints,

97
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,910
and let's assume each of
those sprints is time fixed

98
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,073
to two weeks each.

99
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:34,150
Those three sprints make up one release.

100
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,560
That release now is a
month and a half long,

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,040
and we have four of those.

102
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,740
So if we put those four releases
at a month and a half each,

103
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,770
together we get a
six-month management stage.

104
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,760
And so you can start
seeing how these things

105
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,800
are going to tie together from sprints

106
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,046
into releases into management stages.

107
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,320
Now, that's great to
understand what it looks like

108
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,460
inside just one controlling stage,

109
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,011
but what does it look like
across the entire project?

110
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,780
Well, here's where you're going
to start seeing it be done

111
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,210
in two different ways.

112
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,951
There's the typical Agile way of doing it,

113
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,610
which is to start up and
initiate the project,

114
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,490
and in that we're going to get our vision

115
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,920
and our product backlog,

116
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,620
and then from that we're going to develop

117
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,420
what's going to be put into each stage

118
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,862
by pulling in things to a sprint backlog.

119
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,570
That sprint backlog
then goes into a sprint,

120
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,600
which gets worked on,

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,550
and eventually we get a shippable product

122
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,660
that gets moved out.

123
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,280
Now if we look at this where
we use a larger process

124
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,540
and we start doing it
with releases and sprints

125
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,000
and not just sprints,

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,051
we're going to have our
vision and product backlog

127
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,280
done in the starting up a project.

128
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,640
In our initiating a project,

129
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,590
we'll create our release backlog.

130
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,480
Then we'll pull in what
we're going to work on

131
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,650
for that particular
sprint, that next stage,

132
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,600
and that'll be done in a
controlling a stage process,

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,060
and that will then move into the sprint,

134
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,210
where the work is done,

135
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,160
and then that goes out into our product

136
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,970
that is going to be shipped and fulfilled.

137
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,520
And you can see how
this all works together

138
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,770
and ties together.

139
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,240
Notice much of the Agile way of working

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,890
is going to be handled
down at the delivery layer.

141
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,370
It's going to be working on the team

142
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,050
at the project manager and below.

143
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,568
It's not going to really affect
the project board as much

144
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,400
because they're still going to
have that overarching control

145
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,170
and governance for each
of the seven processes.

146
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,430
And we'll talk about that more

147
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,930
as we go through this section.
