1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,200
- When PRINCE2 was being developed,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,030
they went back and looked at
a lot of different projects

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,640
and they started asking
two main questions.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,020
First, why did this other project succeed?

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,990
And second, why did this project fail?

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,280
As they went back and looked
at all of these projects

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,430
they started finding
commonality about them.

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,320
And when they looked at
all those commonalities

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,850
they started developing
these best practices.

10
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,170
And they started seeing

11
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,200
that if you had these certain things,

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,140
projects were more
likely to be successful.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,730
And if you were missing
some of those things

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,320
you were more likely to fail.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,990
Those things are known
as the seven principles.

16
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,850
These are the seven key
principles to having a project

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,941
that is more likely to succeed.

18
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,510
In PRINCE2 everything else is built on top

19
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,140
of these seven principles.

20
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,350
What are these seven
principles, you might wonder.

21
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,230
Well, they are the Continued
business justification,

22
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,610
learn from experience,

23
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,650
defined roles and responsibilities,

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,360
manage by stages, manage by exception,

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,670
focus on products,

26
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,020
and tailor to suit the
project environment.

27
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,380
Now, we're going to
talk about each of these

28
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,218
in this lecture so you can understand

29
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,860
what their purpose is
and why they're important

30
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,170
to our project.

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,820
The first is continued
business justification.

32
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,760
Continued business justification
is all about insuring

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,970
that your project remains
desirable, viable and achievable.

34
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,380
We do this continually
checking that project,

35
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,300
and if there is ever a time that there is

36
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,330
not a continued business justification,

37
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,310
we should stop working on this project.

38
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,560
We shouldn't invest
more resources into it.

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,860
As we look at the continued
business justification,

40
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,950
we're trying to balance
between our advantages

41
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,110
that are going to be gained

42
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,370
and the impact of implementation.

43
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,650
When we look at advantages,

44
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,240
that's things like reduced
cost and time and risk.

45
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,860
It might be to give us more benefits.

46
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,631
It may be to improve our
quality or our scope.

47
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:45,050
On the other side, we have
the impact of implementation.

48
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,570
This is things like the cost
and duration of the option

49
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,030
that we're choosing to
use, the risk of the option

50
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,210
that we're choosing to use,

51
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,335
and all of those negative
things that might happen.

52
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:56,130
As we balance this, if
there's more of a positive

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,720
than a negative, then we have

54
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,840
a continued business
justification and we should

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,030
keep moving forward with our project.

56
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,920
This second principle is
learn from experience.

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,300
Learn from experience
recognizes the fact that

58
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,440
we're always going to have
mistakes and accidents

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,190
that happen during a project.

60
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,390
But the key concept here
is that we want to learn

61
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,590
from those so we don't repeat them.

62
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,760
How do we do that?

63
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,010
Well, during a project

64
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,330
we should be collecting lessons learned.

65
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,180
For example, if we ordered something

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,440
from an overseas supplier

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,820
and there was a delay at customs

68
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,220
and that caused our
project schedule to slip,

69
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,760
that's something we have to
be aware of next time we order

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,150
from an overseas supplier.

71
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,060
And so these are things
we would write down

72
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,700
and pass amongst the other project teams.

73
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,000
As we collect all these
reports, these lessons learned

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,330
from the previous projects,

75
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,740
that helps us figure
out what we need to put

76
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,160
mitigations in place for
those negative things

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,980
so that we can solve them this time

78
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,850
and avoid those problems.

79
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,240
Also, you can learn positive things.

80
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,720
For example, if I wanted
to build a new website,

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,980
I might want to go back to somebody

82
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,840
who has successfully
run that type of project

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,660
in the past and ask them questions

84
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,970
about what they did and what worked well.

85
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,670
Was outsourcing effective for them?

86
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,120
Or did they need to in-source?

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,780
Was doing the design first
or the coding first better?

88
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,920
Whatever those things are,

89
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,810
we can gather that information and learn

90
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,310
from other people's experience

91
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,803
and we can put that into place inside

92
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:14,080
our own project to do things better,

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,440
faster, cheaper and more efficiently.

94
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,860
The next one we have is defined
roles and responsibilities.

95
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,970
Everyone in the project
should know exactly what

96
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,480
role they're going to be
fulfilling inside the project

97
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,790
and their associated responsibilities.

98
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,430
If you are the team
manager, that has a certain

99
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,850
set of responsibilities.
If you're the executive

100
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,570
or the supplier, those have
certain responsibilities.

101
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,610
And you should understand what they are.

102
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,920
By doing this we're going to provide

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,880
terms of reference and role descriptions

104
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,200
for each and every team
member so they know

105
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,460
what their job is.

106
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,070
And this is going to make sure that each

107
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,540
team member has a correct
level of authority

108
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,130
to perform their role, too.

109
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,730
Because if I make you the executive

110
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,260
but you're not empowered to
make budgeting decisions,

111
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,725
then you're not going to
be effective in that role.

112
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:58,120
Every single person who
works on this project,

113
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
we need to make sure they have ample time

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,310
to dedicate to the project

115
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,900
because one of the problems that I've had

116
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,610
in previous places I've worked

117
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,230
is that they're going to
assign somebody all of the work

118
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,260
and that person can't do all of the work

119
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,540
because there's only
so many hours in a day.

120
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,350
And so if you're working
on three other projects

121
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,183
and I come up to you and say,

122
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,820
Hey can you help me with this one?

123
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,990
Your answer may be, no, I can't

124
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,620
because I don't have the time.

125
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,830
And that's okay.

126
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,960
As the project manager, I
want to make sure the people

127
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm assigning have the time and capability

128
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,170
to put into my project so
that we can be successful.

129
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,859
Because if they don't
and they just say yes,

130
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:32,690
then I'm being set up for failure.

131
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,640
The next one we have
is managing by stages.

132
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,567
To manage by stages means
that we're going to break down

133
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:41,620
this really large concept
into smaller parts.

134
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,830
So for example, if I
wanted to build a car,

135
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,060
that's a fairly complex operation.

136
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,350
We've got a lot of things, from the idea,

137
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,100
the designing, the
engineering, the manufacturing,

138
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,080
putting all the pieces together, painting

139
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,800
the car and delivering
it, that have to be done.

140
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,700
We would then break that up into numerous

141
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,720
other stages that are smaller
pieces of that project.

142
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,940
And we can work through those and agree

143
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,480
to the details at each stage of what

144
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,090
we're expecting to get out of it.

145
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,150
By doing this, it will
help us estimate better

146
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,060
what the costs are for that stage

147
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,250
and what the time is for that stage.

148
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,930
Because if I asked you to
develop me a brand new car,

149
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,110
how long would it take you?

150
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,520
How much would it cost?

151
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
You probably don't know those answers

152
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,170
because it's such a
long and complex thing.

153
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,280
But if I said, how much
would it cost for you

154
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,760
to paint the car and how
long would that take?

155
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,720
You could probably figure
that out pretty quickly.

156
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,020
And so by breaking this
down into smaller chunks,

157
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,700
it allows us to get more
accurate detail with the things

158
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,810
that are closest to us
as opposed to the things

159
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,130
that are further out in our timeline.

160
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,370
The next one we have
is manage by exception

161
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,350
and this is one of my favorite principles.

162
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,015
Because it makes sure
that only significant

163
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,920
deviations from a budget or approved plan

164
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,230
are brought up to the
attention of management.

165
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,371
If I'm the project manager,
I don't need to know

166
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,530
every single detail that's going on

167
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,790
inside the project.

168
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,854
I need to know what
things are going outside

169
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,660
the boundaries that I've set up.

170
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,840
And so my team managers should be working

171
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,520
on their team packages
with the detail they need.

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,410
They're closer to the problem
and they understand it better.

173
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,060
By managing by exception,
we can get a lot more

174
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,420
work done because I'm
empowering the people

175
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,180
below me in this management organization

176
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,020
to make those decisions.

177
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,000
So, a good example of this is looking

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,570
at it from the opposite lens.

179
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,590
What does it look like when you

180
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,240
don't manage by exception?

181
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,290
Well, we sometimes refer
to this as micromanagement.

182
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,730
I don't know about you, but I've worked

183
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,750
for some micromanagers before.

184
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,890
I've had people where I
couldn't order pencils

185
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,210
for the office without going up to some

186
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,410
very high level manager
and getting their approval

187
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,090
for a $3 purchase.

188
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,250
That's just silly.

189
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,090
You want to make sure you give your people

190
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,650
good left and right limits

191
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,280
and let them operate between them.

192
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,996
And that's the whole concept
of management by exception.

193
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,620
Next, we have focus on products.

194
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,290
PRINCE2 is very focused on
delivering the end product.

195
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,060
And there's other products along the way

196
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,250
that will be delivered.

197
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,230
The idea of focus on
products is to successfully

198
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,467
deliver products leading

199
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,500
to the project's benefits being realized.

200
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,570
If I have to build the car, and I don't

201
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,646
get the whole car built,
then my end customer

202
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:08,390
can't have a way to
drive to and from work,

203
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,460
because that's the benefit
they want to realize.

204
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,980
It's the same thing in technology.

205
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,510
If I'm going to build a website,

206
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,100
and I don't build the entire website

207
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,980
from end to end

208
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,210
there's nothing there
for the customer to use.

209
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,240
And so we have this focus on delivering

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,810
the output at the end.

211
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,280
Now, when we start talking about Agile,

212
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,519
we're going to break
that down even smaller

213
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,810
to deliver smaller pieces that give us

214
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,780
usable ability, but when we look at

215
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,130
focus on products as a macro scale,

216
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,490
we are looking at getting some successful

217
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,550
delivered products into the hands of

218
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,710
those who are using it to
realize those benefits.

219
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,730
Our last principle is
probably one of the most

220
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,690
important ones inside of PRINCE2.

221
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,359
And it's tailoring to suit
the project environment.

222
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:48,590
PRINCE2 is a highly
adaptable framework that can

223
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,720
be specifically tailored to meet the needs

224
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,270
of each and every product.

225
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,070
And those tailorings are going to happen

226
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,810
based on different factors.

227
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,260
For example, not all projects operate

228
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,280
in the same cultural environment.

229
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,070
If I have a team who's making a website

230
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,590
here in the United States and a team

231
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,260
who's making one in India,
those are two different

232
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,044
cultural things and we're
going to have to change

233
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:10,230
some of the ways that we run this project

234
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,180
based on those cultural differences.

235
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,550
We also have geography.

236
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,730
We may look at something
that is built in America

237
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,370
versus something that is built in China

238
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,500
and you're going to have different costs

239
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,730
associated with that,
different manufacturing,

240
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,800
and different labor considerations.

241
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,210
Complexity is another one.

242
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,770
If you start looking at complexity,

243
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,080
these projects can be
very complex or very easy.

244
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,640
And depending on that,
we're going to put more

245
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,780
governance and controls in place.

246
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,310
If I'm building a car,
that is a very expensive

247
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,700
proposition and a very complex one,

248
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,750
so I'm going to have to make
lots of different stages

249
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,453
and lots of governance and control.

250
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,100
If instead I'm looking
at building something

251
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,000
like a piece of software that's
just going to do one function,

252
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,290
that might be a very simple aspect

253
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,510
and so it might not need all of the rigor

254
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,420
and governance controls that PRINCE2

255
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,840
would normally afford to it

256
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,160
and so we'll scale that back down.

257
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,600
The other thing we look
at is the scale itself.

258
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,010
How big or how small is the project?

259
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,860
If it's something that's
a million dollar project,

260
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,500
we're going to have a
lot more controls on it

261
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,740
than something that's a $10 project.

262
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,040
And finally, risk.

263
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,950
How risky is the thing you're doing?

264
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,170
A good example of this
is when I built my house.

265
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,610
I built it with a builder
who happens to build

266
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,190
a lot of this same style house

267
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,250
and so it was a very low risk evolution

268
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,070
because they've already built
20 or 30 of those before.

269
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,060
Now if I went and got a custom house made

270
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,240
and we had to choose every single piece

271
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,410
and we were using a builder who had never

272
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,810
built a house before, that's highly risky

273
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,750
and so we would have
more stages and we would

274
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,380
scope the project appropriately

275
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,170
with more governance and more control

276
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,780
to be able to address those risks

277
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,230
as we go through the project.
