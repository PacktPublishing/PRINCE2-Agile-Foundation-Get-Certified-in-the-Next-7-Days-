1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:02,000
- In this video, we're going to talk about

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Lean Startup, and the whole idea with

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,389
Lean Startup as an agile methodology is

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,848
for us to fail fast and learn fast.

5
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:11,508
The concept of the Lean Startup method

6
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,779
is for us to develop business practices

7
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:16,589
and products very, very quickly.

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,277
The whole concept is to shorten your

9
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:19,739
development life cycle by doing

10
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,984
experimentation, iterative
product releases,

11
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:25,588
learning something very
quickly and whether

12
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:27,979
you fail or you succeed,
that's going to tell

13
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29,859
you something that you can implement into

14
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:32,119
the next release, and we want to validate

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,040
our learning and that's the whole concept.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,568
When you start talking about Lean Startup,

17
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,848
there's a couple of key
terms you have to know.

18
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,059
The first one of those is MVP,

19
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:43,189
or Minimum Viable Product.

20
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,379
Minimum Viable Product is this version

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,608
of your product that allows you to collect

22
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,927
the maximum amount of validated learning

23
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:52,227
with the least amount of effort.

24
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:55,459
So, if I wanted to build
a program in software,

25
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,368
I don't need to program every single

26
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,269
function and feature out there to

27
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,287
make it and release that product.

28
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:03,659
Instead, I need to put the core pieces

29
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,739
into that software, release it into the

30
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,248
environment, and see what I can learn

31
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:10,429
based on the customer feedback.

32
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:12,600
The idea here is for us to test those

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,581
business hypotheses that we have

34
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,069
and make these leap-of-faith assumptions.

35
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,139
This allows us as a company to determine

36
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:21,600
very quickly if an idea is really viable

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,709
and worth continued investment,

38
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,308
and the whole idea with an MVP or

39
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:27,648
this minimum viable product is for us to

40
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:30,387
really get something out
into the world quickly.

41
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,549
Now, it doesn't have to
be your final product

42
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,389
and it doesn't have to
go into operational use.

43
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,968
You can do it as an
experiment or a prototype.

44
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,579
That's okay too. The
idea is to get something

45
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,339
into the hands of your end-users

46
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:43,389
so they can tell you, do they like it,

47
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,760
do they not like it and
by doing that, we can

48
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,599
find out very quickly
before we invest a ton of

49
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,079
money and a ton of
resources at this product,

50
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,389
is it something that
people are going to buy.

51
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:56,258
This is very, very common
in the online space,

52
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:58,669
a lot of online products go on Kickstarter

53
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,379
now, right and when they do that,

54
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,419
they're doing a minimum viable product.

55
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,389
What they do is they make a video or

56
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:06,208
a commercial for the product that may

57
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,576
not even exist and see
if they can get funding

58
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:11,509
for it and if they do,
that validates their idea

59
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,679
and they go forth and build the product.

60
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:15,229
That is the minimum
viable product they need

61
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:17,339
to be able to get money
and get that commitment.

62
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,808
It's just a video. Now, in the real world,

63
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:21,469
we often will have to put out something

64
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,829
tangible so that people
can get that minimum

65
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,939
viable product, use it, figure out if they

66
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,499
like it, and then give
us feedback from there,

67
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,598
but either way, the idea is the same.

68
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:33,368
We want to get something
out there, quickly,

69
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:35,166
so we can learn from
it and that's going to

70
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,128
bring us to our next
thing, which is called

71
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,487
continuous development.

72
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,960
In lean startup, this is very heavily used

73
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,888
in the software development space.

74
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,949
The whole idea with continuous development

75
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,488
is for us to be able to
get something out there

76
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,304
and then quickly iterate it and get

77
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,709
the second version, the third version

78
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,949
and the fourth version out there.

79
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,099
Instead of giving us this fully, finished,

80
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,509
and polished thing,
we're going to have all

81
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,342
the code written very quickly

82
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:01,088
and immediately deployed
out into production.

83
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:03,589
Now, this is horrible from
a security standpoint,

84
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:05,405
but it is great from an operations

85
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:06,394
standpoint because we can get

86
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,616
things out there very, very, quickly.

87
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,274
This is going to help
reduce development cycles

88
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,445
and when you're talking about using agile

89
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,034
Lean startup is one of
the most agile methods

90
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,386
in this case because they can lead

91
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:18,234
to daily production releases and

92
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:20,445
sometimes multiple times per day.

93
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:22,066
Now, since we're going to be putting this

94
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,984
with more governance and framework

95
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,153
by using Prince2, we're
actually going to do this

96
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,415
as part of our timebox and we're going to

97
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,084
release things at the end of a time box.

98
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,394
So, two weeks or four weeks, which gives

99
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:33,873
us more time for testing
before deployment,

100
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:35,306
but in lean startup, the idea

101
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:37,706
is get things out continuously.

102
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,854
We're not going to stop
and wait for a deadline.

103
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,245
Instead, we're going to do
it as soon as it's ready,

104
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,386
push it out, and see if it works.

105
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,525
So again, this could be
really bad for security

106
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,233
and it can cause a lot
of issues if you don't

107
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:51,405
have proper testing in
place. So keep that in mind.

108
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,474
The next one we have is split testing,

109
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,426
also known as AB Testing.

110
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:57,085
This is where you create two version of

111
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,306
your product and you offer them out,

112
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,416
so let's go back to our
kickstarter example.

113
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,506
Maybe we make two
different versions of the

114
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,874
product, or two different
videos for the product

115
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:08,125
and see which one performs better.

116
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,826
The whole goal here is for us to observe

117
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,363
the differences in behavior
between two customer

118
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:15,234
groups and so, if I take
this course for example

119
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,563
maybe I'm going to have
one background that has

120
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,746
a white background with purple text on it

121
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:21,376
and I have another
background that's purple

122
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:23,994
with white text and I
put out two identical

123
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:25,685
versions of the product,
but one with purple

124
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,913
and one with white and I see which group

125
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:29,845
of students like it
better, which one gives

126
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:32,405
us better reviews, which
one sells more copies,

127
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,034
all of that kind of thing.

128
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,786
That's the idea with split testing.

129
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:37,414
Very similar product
with different versions

130
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:39,656
to figure out which features the students

131
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:42,605
like best or the customers, in your case.

132
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,506
When you do AB testing,
the important thing

133
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:46,313
to remember is it should always be done

134
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:49,106
at the same time to minimize variables.

135
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:51,194
A lot of companies do
this wrong and they'll do

136
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,474
this week we're going to sell product one

137
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,554
and next week, we're
going to sell product two.

138
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:57,226
That's different times, different cultural

139
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,965
situations, and different
amounts of students.

140
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,616
Instead, we should do
both of them this week

141
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:04,283
and see which one sells better,

142
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,485
and this can be done
very well in an automated

143
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:08,074
environment, especially
when you're dealing

144
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,336
with website testing because you can serve

145
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,346
up version one to the first customer,

146
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,114
version two to the second and keep going

147
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,714
back and forth and then see the results.

148
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:18,245
Now, the next one we're
going to talk about is

149
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:21,096
the process inside of lean startup,

150
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,674
and they call this build-measure-learn

151
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:26,054
process as you can see here on the screen.

152
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:28,136
The process starts with an idea.

153
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:30,394
We have an idea for a
product and immediately

154
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,426
we're going to jump into building it.

155
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:34,186
As we build this, we're going to

156
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:36,405
create our product and release it.

157
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,034
Notice that we're only
halfway through the cycle,

158
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:39,965
but we've already released a product.

159
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,845
Then, once that product is
out there, we're going to

160
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,243
measure what we get
back from our customers.

161
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,713
That's feedback, right.
We collect all of that,

162
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,474
which gives us data.
That data is in analyze

163
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,656
so we can learn something
and that is going to

164
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:53,666
give us an idea for what version to the

165
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,934
product will look like and then we'll

166
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:57,176
build version two, we'll
release version two,

167
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,826
measure version two, we'll collect data on

168
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,453
version two, and we'll
learn from version two,

169
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,496
and then, we create
version three, and we keep

170
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,466
going through this loop over
and over and over again.

171
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,005
The whole idea is to
get ideas to market as

172
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,565
quickly as possible, so
we can learn something,

173
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:14,154
and we're either going to
fail fast and learn fast,

174
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,320
or we're going to
succeed. Either way, we're

175
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,546
going to learn something very quickly

176
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,505
and get to the next, better version.
