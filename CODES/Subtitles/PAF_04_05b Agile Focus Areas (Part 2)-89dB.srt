1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,462
- The next thing we're going
to talk about is requirements,

2
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:05,506
and requirements are the
currency of an Agile project.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,060
Requirements are going to tell
us what this product is going to

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,104
look like at the end.

5
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:12,485
We'll start with high-level
requirements, these are things

6
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:14,470
like project product descriptions.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,498
It's the vision for the
product, it's product groupings,

8
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:20,864
we also might call these 'epics'
or 'huge stories' that give

9
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,064
us lots of features with
these high-level requirements.

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,703
And when we do that, we're
going to use a thing called the

11
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:29,613
MoSCoW prioritization, which
we'll talk about later.

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,249
This'll help us prioritize
those requirements in the things

13
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:36,864
must have, we should have, we
can't have, and we won't have.

14
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,149
Now, when we look at lower-level
requirements, this is down

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,352
at the team level.

16
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:42,434
These are our project
descriptions, they are our

17
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:45,684
requirements, they are
detailed features, they're user

18
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:48,988
stories that say "as a user,
I want to be able to do this

19
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,674
thing with the product".

20
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:53,212
And they're going to have these
lower-level requirements as

21
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,863
we go through, to really
give us the detail we need

22
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:57,234
to build across.

23
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:59,884
We're going to prioritize these
based on order, what is the

24
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:03,166
most important and what is
the least important, as we go

25
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,294
through and we work
through those problems.

26
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:07,632
Now as we move forward when
we look at these requirements,

27
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:10,936
we're going to start out all
the way with this big project

28
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,544
product description at the top.

29
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:14,717
This is a very high-level requirement.

30
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,162
We can then break that down.

31
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:19,329
So if I'm talking about a car,
we have a car as our project

32
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,672
product description.

33
00:01:20,672 --> 00:01:23,583
It's going to have X amount
of seats, X amount of doors

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,021
and tires, you know, it's going
to be able to do this type

35
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:27,590
of thing.

36
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,892
Now, we don't know all of the
details that go in to making

37
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:33,302
that car yet, we just know we need a car.

38
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,714
We start breaking that down,
and so we'll have the engine

39
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:38,736
product group, we'll have
the electrical product group,

40
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:41,565
we will have the comfort
product group, right?

41
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:43,232
We'll have the safety
product group, which might be

42
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:45,437
the airbags and the brakes
and things like that.

43
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:46,996
And then we'll take on of those
product groups, like let's

44
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,747
say we're going to take the
electronics group, and in

45
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:51,784
that electronics group we're
going to break that down in

46
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,757
to different product descriptions as well.

47
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:56,123
We might have on for the radio,
we might have another one

48
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:57,510
for the headlights.

49
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,815
And then underneath the radio
we'll have the different

50
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:00,477
functions it should require.

51
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,619
In this radio, we need and
AM/FM radio, we need a tape

52
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,253
player, we need a CD player,
the ability to hook up

53
00:02:06,253 --> 00:02:08,427
an iPhone, whatever those things are.

54
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:10,830
And you can see we take it
from this big, overwhelming

55
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,906
product, right, this car,
we've broken it down to

56
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:16,633
the electronics, and then
from the electronics down to

57
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,593
the radio, and from the
radio down to the different

58
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:19,692
functions.

59
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:21,683
And as we went from higher-level
to lower-level, we should

60
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,090
get more detailed in the
level of requirements we're

61
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,413
going to do.

62
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,015
Now, this is called decomposition,
and we'll talk more about

63
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,888
this as we go through.

64
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,912
The next Agile focus area we
have is rich communication,

65
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:35,735
because communication
problems can really derail

66
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,718
your project.

67
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:39,512
Whenever you can, you need
to proactively address

68
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:43,551
communication problems and
fix them, early and often.

69
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:46,464
Effective communication is
so fundamental to the way

70
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,423
we work in Agile, because
everything is team-based

71
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:52,311
and collaborative, and if
we can't communicate, we're

72
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:54,827
going to fall apart really
quickly, and we're not going to

73
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,060
be able to work in an Agile method.

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,078
Communication can take place
in many different formats.

75
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:03,184
It can be the traditional
E-mail or text message.

76
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,917
It can be written word,
such as writing it down on

77
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,897
a piece of paper or on a whiteboard.

78
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,607
It can be visualization by
drawing out pictures and using

79
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,189
kanban charts and things like that.

80
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,599
We can do it verbally
over the telephone or even

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,620
face-to-face.

82
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,528
There are lots and lots of
different ways to communicate

83
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:20,361
nowadays.

84
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,508
You have to figure out what's
going to be the best one that's

85
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:24,195
going to work well in your team.

86
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:28,798
Now, according to the Prince2
Agile exam, the best, fastest,

87
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:32,177
clearest, and most efficient
way to communicate is still

88
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,343
old-fashioned face-to-face communication.

89
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,794
Whenever possible, get
everyone in a room and talk to

90
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,272
them eye-to-eye.

91
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:42,024
By doing this, this is going
to help reduce the level

92
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:44,797
of formality, and it's
going to allow us to be able

93
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,716
to communicate quickest and
fastest because a lot of our

94
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:50,650
communication happens
through body language.

95
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,314
Now, when you deal with
technology, technology and your

96
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,209
level of formality needs
to be considered because if

97
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,138
you're across three or four
different states, you might have

98
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,026
to rely on things like Skype
to use video conferencing,

99
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,718
or you may have to just use E-mails.

100
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,688
These are things you're going
to have to consider as part

101
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:07,818
of your project.

102
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:10,219
Sometimes you need a
high level of formality.

103
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,968
If you're going to be putting
up a report, for instance,

104
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,562
that would be in written
form, not face-to-face

105
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,922
communication.

106
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,429
Written word does have it's
place, but there are a lot

107
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:22,120
of disadvantages when
dealing with written word.

108
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,002
Have you ever gotten a text
message from somebody and

109
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,810
you're not exactly sure if
they were joking or not?

110
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,668
Well if they had told you
that face-to-face, you

111
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,912
would've known, right?

112
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:31,312
Because you can read the body language.

113
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,584
And this is one of those
drawbacks from written word

114
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:34,417
to verbal.

115
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:37,758
Your project manager or your
team manager is going to be

116
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:41,062
responsible and aware of
how this team is going to be

117
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,141
communicating.

118
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:44,403
It's their responsibility
to come up with a good

119
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:48,080
communication plan and help
encourage the team to use it.

120
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,039
Communication does need to
be organized and it does

121
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,392
need to be planned.

122
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,514
One of the ways that we do
that is our daily stand-up

123
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:56,880
meetings as part of
our Scrum cycle, right?

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,795
Every morning we stand up
and for 15 minutes we go over

125
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:02,588
what we did yesterday and
what we're going to do today.

126
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:05,127
That's part of rich
communication, and again when that

127
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:07,941
can occur face-to-face that
is going to be the best way

128
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,506
of doing it.

129
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:11,626
One of the questions I
often get asked when people

130
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:14,605
start working an Agile
environment is: "How should I

131
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,793
communicate?", and I will
tell you that I am a big fan

132
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:20,978
of face-to-face communication
and using a lot of

133
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,317
visualization.

134
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:24,395
Because if I can draw
something up on the board, it's

135
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:27,706
going to be a lot clearer
than if we use a lot of words,

136
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:31,187
and so a three-page E-mail
is not nearly as effective

137
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:33,543
as a one-page infographic.

138
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:35,811
So that's the idea here
with visualization and then,

139
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:38,411
if I can do that in a face-to-face
manner, that's going to

140
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,574
eliminate a lot of
those questions as well.

141
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,918
So for the exam, remember
lots of visualization, lots

142
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,190
of face-to-face.

143
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,868
These are good things when
you're trying to communicate

144
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:47,865
effectively.
