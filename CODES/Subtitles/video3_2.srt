1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,070
- There are a lot of different
Agile Frameworks out there

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,480
on the market today.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,690
Many of these frameworks
are going to combine

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,680
different techniques and tactics

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,610
and give us the ability
to do things in a faster,

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,150
more efficient way.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,460
Some of these are more common than others,

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,000
and a lot of these are only focused on IT

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,990
because that's where a
lot the world of Agile

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,520
developed from.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,320
They're all going to
focus on kind of three

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,770
main concepts though.

13
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,470
It's either the planning phase,

14
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,440
the collaborate and build phase,

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,080
or the deliver phase,

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,430
and we're going to talk about
that as we go through here

17
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,790
and talk about the Agile Frameworks.

18
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,790
Now, on the screen,

19
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,800
you're going to see 12
different Agile Frameworks.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,360
We have Scrum, Kanban, Lean Startup,

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,259
Lean, XP, SAFe, DAD,

22
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,710
DSDM or AgilePM,

23
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,910
DevOps, FDD, Crystal, and ASD.

24
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,760
Now, the question I get from students is

25
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,880
do I have to know all of these frameworks,

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,640
and the answer is no.

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,880
If you see the name,

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,760
you should recognize that
these are Agile Frameworks,

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,640
but you don't need to know
the specifics of each one

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,340
with the exception of three of them.

31
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,090
Scrum, Kanban, and Lean Startup,

32
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,690
and we're going to talk
about each of those

33
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,330
in a separate lecture in
the next three lectures,

34
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,360
because they really do make
up a very important part

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,953
inside of the PRINCE2 Agile Framework.
