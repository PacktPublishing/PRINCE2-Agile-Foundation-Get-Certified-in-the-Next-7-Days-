1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,330
- Next, we're going to
look at the seven themes.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,650
If you remember, the seven
themes are these areas

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,440
of project management
that we have to address

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,180
continuously over and over
again throughout our project.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,590
These themes are based
upon those seven principles

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,710
we just talked about,

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,290
and those agile implementations of them.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,020
Now, as we look through the seven themes

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,590
and we look at the business case,

10
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,390
organization, quality, plans,

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,810
risk, change, and progress,

12
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,550
we have to look at how they're applied

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,250
inside an agile method,

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,950
and we're going to do that in
this section of the course.
