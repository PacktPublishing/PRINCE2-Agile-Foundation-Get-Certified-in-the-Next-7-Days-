1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,920
- In this lesson we're going
to talk about the exam itself.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,350
We're going to talk about how long it is,

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,930
how many questions it is,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,140
and really what the point
of the whole exam is.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,510
And let's talk about that first.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,170
What is the point of the
PRINCE2 Agile Foundation exam?

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,900
Well, if you pass it, you're
going to gain the first level

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,410
of certification inside the
PRINCE2 Agile framework.

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,070
The second level is Practitioner,

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,870
and to be able to take the Practitioner,

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,640
you have to have already
passed a Foundation level exam,

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,470
whether that's the PRINCE2 Foundation

13
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,630
or the PRINCE2 Agile Foundation.

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,690
When you look at this,
it's really going to ask,

15
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,260
can you understand how to blend PRINCE2

16
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,930
with Agile techniques?

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,970
And they really want to know
one fundamental question.

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,707
Are you able to know enough about PRINCE2

19
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:45,500
and Agile to work effectively inside of

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,580
a project management team
underneath a PRINCE2 environment?

21
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,450
If you can, that's the level

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,370
that we're looking for for Foundation.

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,330
That means you have to
understand the terms,

24
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,970
the techniques, and the tactics

25
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,030
that are used by both PRINCE2 and Agile.

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,070
So, when we look at this and
we start looking at this exam,

27
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,100
there are going to be five exam objectives

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,050
that we're going to cover,
and the rest of this course

29
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,340
is all built around these five things.

30
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,800
Think of it as our table of contents.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,530
The first one is, do you
understand key concepts

32
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,780
relating to projects and PRINCE2?

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,800
This is your traditional
PRINCE2 framework.

34
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,430
The second one is, do you
understand key concepts

35
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,820
relating to projects and
PRINCE2 in an Agile environment?

36
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,780
This starts bringing in
those Agile concepts.

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,620
Number three, do you understand
PRINCE2 principles, themes,

38
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,960
processes, and management
products and how to tailor them

39
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,790
and apply them inside of an Agile context?

40
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,160
Number four, do you understand
the Agile ways of working,

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,710
the key terms, and the techniques?

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,630
And number five, do you
understand the focus areas

43
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,660
that apply inside of an Agile context?

44
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,340
So when you sit down to
take the exam on test day,

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,580
you're going to find that
there are 50 questions

46
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,610
you have to answer in one hour.

47
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,340
And these questions come in the form

48
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,890
of multiple choice questions
with choices A, B, C, or D.

49
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,700
Now, those multiple choice questions,

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,460
they'll show up as three
different types of format.

51
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,220
The vast majority of these are going to be

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,560
what we call standard
multiple choice questions,

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,860
where they might give you
a definition and then ask,

54
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,210
based on A, B, C, or D, which
terms matches that definition.

55
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,030
When we have a list type question,

56
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,350
this is one where they'll
give you four statements,

57
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,400
labeled one, two, three, and four.

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
And then your multiple choice options,

59
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,540
you'll have to select which of

60
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,390
those two statements are true.

61
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,800
And you'll do that by
choosing A, one and two,

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,800
B, two and three, C, three
and four, or D, one and four.

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,480
And the last type is what
we call a negative question.

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,370
They'll say, which of these are not true?

65
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,200
And then they'll have four
answers, A, B, C, and D,

66
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,320
and you'll select the
one that is not true.

67
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,620
As I said, the vast
majority of the questions

68
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,300
will be standard multiple
choice type though.

69
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,080
Now, to earn your certification,

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,170
you have to get at least 28 questions

71
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,110
out of 50 correct on test day.

72
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,530
That equates to 56%, so if
you can score 56% or higher,

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,490
you're going to pass and get certified.

74
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,780
This is a very doable and
very achievable number.

75
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,410
On exam day, it is closed-book though.

76
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,080
Everything you have to answer is going to

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,670
come out of your head,
not out of a textbook,

78
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,310
and not out of any paper that you bring

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,280
with you into the exam center.

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,890
So how do you know when you're ready

81
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,060
to go take the Foundations exam?

82
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,180
Well, after you've
taken this entire course

83
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,710
and you've watched all the videos,

84
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,140
you're going to take a
practice exam at the end.

85
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,560
When you take that practice exam,

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,720
if you score a 70% or higher,

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,560
you're ready to go take
the real foundations exam.

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,990
Now, wait a minute, Jason,

89
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,090
you said 70% on the practice exam,

90
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,870
but it's only 56% to pass the real exam.

91
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,220
Well, yes, the reason why I say that is

92
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,270
because I want to make
sure that you are ready

93
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,230
and you pass it on the first try

94
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,210
because each time you take that exam,

95
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,860
it costs about $350 to
buy your exam voucher.

96
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,920
And I don't know about you,

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,300
but I only want to have to
take the Foundations exam once

98
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,900
if I'm paying $350 each
time I take that exam.

99
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,710
Now, if you need more practice,

100
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,110
go out and find additional practice exams

101
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,240
to hone your skills to
make sure you're ready

102
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,900
for that certification exam.

103
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,760
But again, if you're scoring 70% or higher

104
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,923
on my practice exam, you
should be fine come test day.
