1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,650
- The next set of seven
we're going to talk about

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,490
is the seven processes.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,490
The seven processes are the application

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,250
of those seven principles
and the seven themes,

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,160
as we go through the project
management lifecycle.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,200
The seven processes are used to describe

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,430
which role, from the
project management team,

8
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,200
is responsible for making decisions

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,830
and when those decisions should be made.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,530
Now, as we go through these
seven processes, you're going to

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,530
see that they all tie in together.

12
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,690
In a linear fashion.

13
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,610
As we go through the project.

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,100
The first process we're
going to talk about

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,780
is starting up a project.

16
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,330
Starting up a project is
used to ensure that all

17
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,550
of the prerequisites for
initiating a project are in place

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,350
by answering a simple question.

19
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,360
Do we have a viable
and worthwhile project?

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,950
In starting up a project,
we're going to have hundreds

21
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,110
of ideas of what project should be done.

22
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,400
And eventually these are
going to be funneled down

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,810
into just one or two ideas
of what we should do.

24
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,650
One of these will end up
becoming the project mandate.

25
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,900
And we'll be told, we should
look at starting up a project

26
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,380
on idea X.

27
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,220
We want to build this thing.

28
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,780
And so we will start the
starting up a project phase.

29
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,400
Where initial research
and analysis will be done

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,550
to determine is this a viable thing to do?

31
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,380
For example, my company
is a training company.

32
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,910
If we had an idea of building
a rocket ship, that's

33
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,740
probably not a very viable
or worthwhile project for us.

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,310
It maybe for other
organizations, but not for us.

35
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,660
And so we have to take the
thousands of ideas that we come

36
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,300
up with, to decide what
is the thing that we're

37
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,130
going to work on next?

38
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,860
Then, once you have that good
idea and it's been approved,

39
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,250
we're going to move into
initiating a project.

40
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,080
And in initiating a project,
we are going to go through

41
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,980
and make sure that we
establish solid foundations

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,140
for this project.

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,980
Because we want to enable the
organization to understand

44
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,910
what is working and what isn't.

45
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,980
And what needs to be done to
deliver the project's products

46
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,320
before we commit to the
significant spending of resources.

47
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,180
And so, going back to my
company's example; we get

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,140
suggestions from students all the time

49
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,080
on different courses we should make.

50
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Now, we might take those 50
or 100 different suggestions

51
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,860
and boil it down to one
or two different ideas

52
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,540
that's going to be our next project.

53
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,090
Then we start going through
our initiating a project phase

54
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,960
and we go and start looking at
what is the cost and benefit

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,900
of doing that.

56
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,960
Is there a big enough
market demand for that thing

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,140
that we're going to teach?

58
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,530
Do we have the knowledge and skills

59
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,000
to train that effectively?

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,340
And as we go through that,
we're going to put everything

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,380
in place and build up our
business case and build up

62
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,250
our project initiation documents,
so that we can then move

63
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,320
forward and build out that next product.

64
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,380
The next process we're going
to talk about is kind of

65
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,270
a unique one.

66
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,930
Because it doesn't sit in
just one stage, but it works

67
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,460
across all of the stages in the project.

68
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,550
It's known as directing a project.

69
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,740
And this is used to
enable the project board

70
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,460
to be accountable for the
project's success by making

71
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,240
key decisions and
exercising overall control

72
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,260
while delegating the day-to-day management

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,270
down to the project manager.

74
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,930
So when we start talking
about starting up a project

75
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,020
and initiating a project and
as we get through the rest

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,880
of the stages, a lot of those are focused

77
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,860
on what the project manager is doing.

78
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,690
But directing a project isn't.

79
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,080
This is where the board takes
input from the project manager

80
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,420
and makes decisions.

81
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,070
This may be the decision
to start up the project.

82
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,370
It may be the decision
to initiate the project.

83
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,810
Or to move from one
stage to the next stage.

84
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,480
Or how to handle an exception or an issue.

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,920
All of this is done at
directing a project.

86
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,790
So when you're thinking
about directing a project

87
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,220
always remember this is decision making

88
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,380
at the project board level.

89
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,790
This brings us down into
the next process, which is

90
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,020
how we manage a stage boundary.

91
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,890
As we get to the end of stage
one or the end of stage two

92
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,690
and we want to move into the
next stage as a project manager,

93
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,370
we have to go back to the project board

94
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,950
and ask permission to do that.

95
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,740
And that's where we initiate this managing

96
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,550
a stage boundary process.

97
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,740
It's going to enable the
project manager to provide

98
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,250
the project board with
sufficient information

99
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,680
for them to review the success

100
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,560
of the current management
stage; approve the stage plan

101
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,840
for the the next stage.

102
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,110
Review the updated project
plan, confirm the continued

103
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,610
business justification and
decide if they're going to

104
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,250
accept the risks and let
the project move forward.

105
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,010
Again, this is simply
where the project manager

106
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,207
comes to the project board
and says, "Here's the current

107
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,817
"status, here's my plan way ahead,

108
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:10,620
"can I move into the next stage?"

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,220
And then if the project
board says yes, they use that

110
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,390
directing a project process
to make that decision

111
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,770
and let us move into the next stage.

112
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,080
That brings us into controlling a stage.

113
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,840
And this again is a
project manager function.

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,360
This is going to be where the
project manager assigns the work

115
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,690
to be done, monitors that
work, deals with any issues

116
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,930
that come up, reports the progress back up

117
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,070
to the project board,
using highlight reports.

118
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,820
And they take corrective
action to ensure that the stage

119
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,760
remains within the tolerances
that they're given.

120
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,440
So this is the day-to-day
work of a project manager.

121
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,760
It's where they spend most of their time.

122
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,740
But this isn't where the product
is actually being created.

123
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,290
This is just the management
of that creation.

124
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,510
For that to be created,
we had to move into

125
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,290
the managing product delivery.

126
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,470
And this is done at the team level.

127
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,960
So this is where the link
between the project manager

128
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,690
and a team manager comes into play.

129
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,480
And where they're going to
agree on the requirements

130
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,150
for the acceptance, execution and delivery

131
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,720
of those products.

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,080
The role of the team manager
here is to coordinate

133
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,560
all of the work that needs to
be done inside their team plan

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,470
here at managing product delivery.

135
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,920
They're the closest ones
to the finished product.

136
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,570
So if I'm talking about
building a website, for example,

137
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,580
I might have the graphics
team working on one package,

138
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,830
and they have a team manager.

139
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,950
And then I might have a
coding team that's working

140
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,440
on another package and
they have a team manager.

141
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,270
The project manager is going to be working

142
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,780
with those individual team
managers to make sure they

143
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,370
understand what the requirements
are for the coding aspect

144
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,060
of the site and the
graphics aspect of the site.

145
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,020
And once they agree to
that, those team managers

146
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,660
will run the daily production.

147
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,193
To get that product delivered.

148
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,170
Next, we have closing a project.

149
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,570
And once we get to the
final stage, this is what we

150
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,130
call closing a project.

151
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,360
This is going to provide us
with a fixed point at which

152
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,340
the acceptance for the
project's product is confirmed

153
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,360
by the end users.

154
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,210
And this is going to
recognize that the objectives

155
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,960
set out by the original
project initiation document

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,190
have been achieved.

157
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,060
So when we started up
this project and we went

158
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,090
to the initiation phase, we
made a list of everything

159
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,160
that this project was going to deliver.

160
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
Now that we're in the closing
a project phase, we're

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,660
going to go back to that
list and make sure that we've

162
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,460
met all those requirements.

163
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,350
Now one of the interesting
things about closing a project

164
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,310
is you don't have to wait
until you've gone through

165
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,660
all the stages to get to this phase.

166
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,896
In fact if we're going
through and say we're in stage

167
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:27,960
two out of 10 and we
decide there is no longer

168
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,230
a continued business justification,
then the project board

169
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,940
can decide that we're going to
terminate work on the project

170
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,800
and jump right into closing a project.

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,500
This means that the project
has nothing more to contribute

172
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,080
and this a time we're going to
go through and just finalize

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,180
everything, release the resources
that we don't need anymore
