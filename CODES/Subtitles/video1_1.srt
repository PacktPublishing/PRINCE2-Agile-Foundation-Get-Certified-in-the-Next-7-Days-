1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,690
- Welcome to this course on
the Prince2 Agile Foundation.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,060
In this course, we're
going to cover everything

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,480
you need to know to study
for, to take, and to pass

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,440
your Prince2 Agile foundation's exam.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,060
In this course we're going
to provide you an excellent

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,150
review of all of the material
covered in the Prince2

7
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,370
Agile guidebook.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,040
Now this isn't an in depth guide.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,140
We're not going to go through
and cover every single

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,980
piece of information
that's in that 400 pages.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,740
But instead, we're going to go
over the most frequently asked

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,530
concepts and help you
focus your study efforts

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,970
so you can pass on the first attempt.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,000
Now my name is Jason
Dion and I am a professor

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,600
and instructor of cyber security
and information technology.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,850
I've been working in those
realms as a professional

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,360
for over 20 years, and during that time,

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,990
I've worked on hundreds
of different projects,

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,930
ranging from just a couple of dollars,

20
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,216
and the way up into the
millions of dollars.

21
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:56,030
In my experience, we've
used both Waterfall

22
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,180
and Agile technologies and
techniques as we've gone

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,120
through these projects.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,260
And as we go through this
course, I'm going to share

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,320
a lot of that experience
with you, so you can see

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,081
how we can apply this in
a real world environment.

27
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,360
Now before we go any
further, I want to give you

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,720
a couple of key pieces of information.

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,330
First, there are closed
captions are available

30
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,163
for this course.

31
00:01:15,163 --> 00:01:17,870
Just hit the CC button at the
bottom of the video player

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,470
and you'll be able to see
all the words going along

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,060
with what I'm speaking.

34
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,190
Now also, when it comes to
speaking, sometimes people say

35
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,500
I talk too fast.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,520
Others say I talk too slow.

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,290
Either way, you get to
control the playback speed.

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,170
If I happen to be talking too
fast, you can slow me down

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,740
by reducing me to .75.

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,040
If I'm talking too slow,
you can speed me up

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,330
by putting me at 1.5x.

42
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,350
Now either way, you can
listen to me at normal speed,

43
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,800
faster or slower, to the
way that it works best

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
for you to learn.

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,040
Now all the information
I'm going to give you

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,600
during this course, I do
have a handout available

47
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,280
as a downloadable resource.

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,430
So please download that
and you can use that

49
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,300
for all fun studying as well.

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,470
And we also have a Facebook
group that is set up

51
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,300
to help you as you're studying.

52
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,140
If you have any questions, or
you get stuck on something,

53
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,070
just go to
Facebook.com/groups/DionTraining,

54
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,420
and join the group and
we'll be happy to help you

55
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,820
and answer any questions you may have.

56
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,230
Now the last thing I want you to know,

57
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,230
is that when you take this
course, you are in good hands.

58
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,560
We're going to help you get
certified in the best way possible.

59
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,630
Dion Training Solutions,
which is my company,

60
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,680

certifications.

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,110

64
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,500
from somebody who is authorized, trained,

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,950
and certified by Axelos,
the owners of the exam.

66
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,850
Also, because you've taken it from us,

67
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,970
you are eligible for a
discount on your exam voucher.

68
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,900

69
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,820
So with all that said, let's
move into our first lecture

70
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,593
and start learning about the exam.
