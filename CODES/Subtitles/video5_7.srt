1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,980
- The next thing we're
going to discuss is risk,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,530
and risk is actually reduced
by working in an Agile method.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,700
The reason for this is
because our Agile techniques

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,310
work in an iterative method,

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,240
and we're allowed to quickly adapt

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,140
when we find an issue
or risk and overcome it.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,290
For example, when we start up a project,

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,400
we go and create our
outlying business case,

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,360
and as we start outlining
that business case,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,660
we're going to avoid
putting too much detail in,

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,110
and that's going to prevent
us from being locked

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,980
into a certain set of requirements.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,110
This allows us to be more
agile during development,

14
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,030
and be able to overcome
risks as they're identified.

15
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,740
Another thing that we do is we
do our daily standup meetings

16
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,870
where we get the delivery team

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,660
all around the information radiator,

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,530
and we all talk about
what we did yesterday

19
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,980
and what we're going to do today.

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,850
During that meeting, we're
also going to identify

21
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,270
any risks or issues that
need to be addressed,

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,870
and we can do that very quickly

23
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,940
at the detail level
inside our delivery team.

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,080
This happens a lot because
we have this self-managed

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,690
and self-directed team as well,

26
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,230
and that allows us to
overcome risks and obstacles

27
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,870
throughout the project.

28
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,090
Additionally, in Agile,
we're going to focus

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,270
on doing frequent demos
and frequent delivery

30
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,780
or releases of products.

31
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,790
By doing that, we're getting
things into the hands

32
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,030
of our customers sooner,

33
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,500
and that gives us additional
customer interaction

34
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,840
that will help us identify any
risks or challenges we have

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,310
in the project so that
we can move forward.

36
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,210
While working in an agile way can help us

37
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,090
to reduce our risk, there
are some unique risks

38
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,810
that will come up because
we're working in an agile way.

39
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,970
For example, when we work in an agile way,

40
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,900
we're continuously going to
be engaging with our customer.

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,150
That engagement gives
us continual feedback

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,480
which is great, but
that continual feedback

43
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,170
may also derail our project,

44
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,470
because we're constantly adjusting

45
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,630
and constantly doing new
requirements and new changes

46
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,180
to the thing we're working on.

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,740
This is a risk that we're
going to have to manage.

48
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,730
Another area that we're going
to tailor inside the risk theme

49
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,360
is that we're going to
reduce the formality

50
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,470
and bureaucracy that usually is seen

51
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,670
inside the risk management procedures.

52
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,460
In PRINCE2, we used something formal,

53
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,150
like an electronic risk register

54
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,740
to capture every single risk

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,510
and what mitigations
we're putting against it

56
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,430
and what residual risk is left over,

57
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,090
but in PRINCE2 Agile, we
may just have a few columns

58
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,270
on our team board or
our information radiator

59
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,570
that's going to capture those risks

60
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,980
and what we're doing about them.

61
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,260
Overall, Agile is going to
place a lot less emphasis

62
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,970
on risk than PRINCE2 does,
and the reason for this

63
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,330
is because risk can be
overcome much quicker

64
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,010
and much easier based
on that self-managing,

65
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,960
self-organizing delivery team.

66
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,090
By using the Agile
concepts and techniques,

67
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,050
we're already mitigating a lot of the risk

68
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,700
that we normally see in a
traditional waterfall development

69
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
because we can react to changes faster,

70
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,690
but Agile does have its own risks

71
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,140
associated with it on its own,

72
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,460
and we assess that by
looking at the Agilometer,

73
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,320
and assessing those six key
areas of our organization

74
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,820
to see, are we going to be able to operate

75
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,280
as an agile organization,
or are we going to be more

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,940
of a formal organization?

77
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,920
Either way, you're going to
be able to identify that early

78
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,430
and put mitigations in place

79
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,530
so that you can have a successful project.
