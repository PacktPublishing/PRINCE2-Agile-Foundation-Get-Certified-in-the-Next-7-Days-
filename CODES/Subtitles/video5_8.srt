1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,090
- Change is inevitable.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,820
In every project you work on,

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,400
whether it's in a waterfall method

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,700
or an Agile method,

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,790
there is going to be change that occurs.

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,870
The difference is how we're
going to react to that change.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,830
When we look at it in an Agile way,

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,380
we're going to try to be more responsive

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,550
to the change at the detailed level.

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,388
Now, into our PRINCE2 Agile project,

11
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:21,008
we do want to make sure that we control

12
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:24,450
significant changes at the project level.

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,250
So when we create the project plan

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,266
and we say we're going to build a car,

15
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,154
we want to make sure that any changes

16
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:31,670
to that design of that car

17
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,164
are controlled up at the project level.

18
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:36,877
Now, when we start talking
about the detail level,

19
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:38,580
that may be when we start talking about

20
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,210
the color of the seats,
the fabric that's chosen,

21
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,385
or any of those other details
down at the team level,

22
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:45,260
that is where change can improve

23
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,040
the quality and usability
of the product much quicker

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,300
and the people designing
it can make those changes

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,360
within good tolerances.

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,910
And that's one of the keys when you start

27
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,570
tailoring your theme of change,

28
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,910
is you want to make sure
that you have good tolerances

29
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,530
because those tolerances that are set

30
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,302
in your product description
and your work package

31
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:04,301
are going to control how
well and how effectively

32
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:08,010
you can control change
and adapt by changing.

33
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,126
For example, when you look
at your product descriptions,

34
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:12,360
this is where your quality criteria

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,050
and your tolerances are originally set

36
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,180
for the project.

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,680
This gives you clear baselines

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,190
that can be managed very formally.

39
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,364
Anytime there's a change
that's going to happen

40
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,960
to one of these baselines,

41
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,226
or go outside these tolerances,

42
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:25,240
it's going to have to escalate all the way

43
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,770
up to the project board
and that change authority

44
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,191
to make the decision.

45
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,680
Now, when you look at the work packages

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,070
at that lower level,

47
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,680
this is where detailed
level change can occur.

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,500
Again, your work packages is going to have

49
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,510
defined tolerances for the team

50
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,570
that's going to say what their
left and right bounds are.

51
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,600
For example, in my car example,

52
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,783
we may have given them the tolerance

53
00:01:45,783 --> 00:01:48,290
that there has to be four seats,

54
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,610
but we didn't tell them what type

55
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,170
of fabric they have to choose.

56
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,545
They have the ability to choose that

57
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,450
based on their desires,

58
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,820
based on what they think will
work best for the customer,

59
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,790
and what will meet the requirement.

60
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,010
This is going to be able to be managed

61
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,200
by the team dynamically,

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,401
as long as they stay
within their tolerances.

63
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:06,160
Now, if we go to something
of a more technical example,

64
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,799
we look at something like a website,

65
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,360
and we say the
responsiveness time has to be

66
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,733
between zero and one hundred milliseconds,

67
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,003
I don't really care which
technology they use,

68
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,570
as long as they stay
within that tolerance.

69
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,000
And so the team can figure out

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,580
what the solution is going to be

71
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,780
that's going to meet my end state.

72
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,220
This all comes down to good
requirements definitions.

73
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,803
Now, requirements definitions can be

74
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:30,310
either binary or on a spectrum.

75
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,712
If they're binary, this means
it's a yes or no question.

76
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:36,710
Going back to my car example,
the car must have four seats.

77
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,568
Does it have four seats?

78
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,070
Yes, they've met the intent.

79
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,837
Now if I looked at it on a spectrum level,

80
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:44,500
does the car have brown seats

81
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,380
and is that brown a color
between five and ten

82
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,940
on our color index?

83
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,900
Now I can look at it.

84
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,710
If it's a four, it's not within that,

85
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,110
it's outside tolerance.

86
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,850
But if it's a five, six,
seven, eight, nine, or ten,

87
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,690
then it's within my tolerance
and it's acceptable.

88
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,450
The idea with change in the theme

89
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,330
is by using good risk management

90
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,713
and good configuration management,

91
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:07,310
we can lessen the impact
of changes to our product.

92
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,870
And the whole idea inside PRINCE2 Agile,

93
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,740
is that we believe that the
team is closest to the problem.

94
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,430
They understand best
what the customer needs,

95
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,780
what the customer wants,

96
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,710
and how to deliver that effectively.

97
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,240
If we give them a good tolerance band,

98
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,900
they can build this thing
within that tolerance

99
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,733
and meet our needs

100
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,360
and dynamically deal with
the changes that come up

101
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,100
as we go through prototyping
and testing and development.

102
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,050
PRINCE2 and PRINCE2 Agile
look at change differently.

103
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,610
If we look at it from
a PRINCE2 perspective,

104
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,160
change is this thing that is cautious.

105
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,390
It's something that we want to avoid.

106
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,999
We want to make sure that all changes

107
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:46,870
are controlled up at the
change authority level

108
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,220
and at the project board level.

109
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,870
It's something where we
just want to make sure

110
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,014
that what we've designed
with all of our detail

111
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:55,550
is followed through in execution.

112
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,140
PRINCE2 Agile, on the other hand,

113
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,790
takes the opposite approach.

114
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,270
We're going to build
requirements very loosely

115
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,160
at the beginning and add
more detail as we go along.

116
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,949
As we go through and create our baselines,

117
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,770
we're going to create them for the correct

118
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,329
level of detail for
blending the work properly.

119
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,660
And what I mean by that is,

120
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,240
back in the starting up a project

121
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,663
and initiating a project phase,

122
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:18,130
we're going to have big,
wide tolerances set up

123
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,060
for our baselines up at the project level.

124
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,162
And we're going to give
a large portion of that

125
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,040
big tolerance down to our team level.

126
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,260
So the team has a lot of room
to make changes autonomously.

127
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,817
As they're working their
collaborative method,

128
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:34,210
they can decide that this project

129
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,930
needs to look more like
this or more like that

130
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,101
because they're closest to the problem.

131
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:41,130
And this is going to allow
them to rapidly respond

132
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,835
to change at the detailed level,

133
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:45,170
in coordination with the product owner

134
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,940
and the customer representatives.

135
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,367
Now, if there's any major
significant changes,

136
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:52,170
that will still go back
up to the project board

137
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,960
or the change authority
under PRINCE2 Agile

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,615
to be able to get approval for that.

139
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:00,060
Our goal in PRINCE2
Agile is to get feedback

140
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,710
as quickly as possible.

141
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,090
So we want to get our product out there

142
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,170
and get it into the hands of our customer.

143
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,420
By getting it to the customer,

144
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,070
we're going to get
feedback that is going to

145
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,924
empower us to make changes
based on that feedback

146
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,860
and get us a better product in the end.

147
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,479
We really do desire true feedback

148
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,760
from our end customer to ensure that

149
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,210
we're giving them what they want

150
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,910
and that it's meeting their needs.

151
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,930
There's lots of feedback loops that exist.

152
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,100
You may hear ones like the OODA loop,

153
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,640
which is the observe,
orient, decide, and act loop.

154
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,430
You may have heard of the PDCA,

155
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,069
which is plan, do, check, and act.

156
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,789
You may have heard of PDSA,

157
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:38,080
which is plan, do, study, and act.

158
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,900
Or you may have seen the
one we talked about earlier

159
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,100
in Lean Startup, build,
measure, and learn.

160
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,940
And in Agile, any of these
loops will work just fine.

161
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,060
Again, you can observe or plan

162
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,970
and then do something and
then act based on that.

163
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,150
In the Lean Startup one, we're
going to build something,

164
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,382
prototype it quickly,
get it out to a customer,

165
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:58,470
measure what the response
is, learn based on that,

166
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,830
and then build the next loop.

167
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,840
And this is the idea,

168
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,270
is getting in that feedback loop

169
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,174
to get a better product
and allowing the team

170
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,575
to make the changes
needed at this low level

171
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,160
and still meeting the
time and cost restrictions

172
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,553
that we've placed upon
them in our project.
