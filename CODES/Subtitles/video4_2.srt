1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,870
- So as we combine PRINCE2 with Agile

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,510
to come up with PRINCE2 Agile frameworks,

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,940
we have to start thinking about

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,020
what does this really come down to.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,250
And if you pull up the Agile guide

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,070
inside your PRINCE2 Agile book,

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,200
it's going to give you
eight guidance points,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,160
and we're going to cover those here.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,890
The first one is that
PRINCE2 is already enabled

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,150
for use with Agile.

11
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,340
And we know this is true
because we can see things

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,830
like tailoring to suit
the project environment

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,300
back with our principles.

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,430
We also see things like organization

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,410
and define rules and responsibility,

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,000
which does take place
within an Agile team.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,280
We see things like
learning from experience

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,480
which is really important

19
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,830
in the Agile iterative way of working.

20
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,070
The second guidance point
we have is that PRINCE2

21
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,140
is suitable for any style of project

22
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,260
and it's not a traditional
project management approach.

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,200
Now what they mean by this is that

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,270
in some traditional project
management approaches,

25
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,740
they are very strict in the
way things have to be done.

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,940
They focus on how things are
done in project management

27
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,370
but PRINCE2, on the other hand,

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,610
focuses on what needs to be
done with project management.

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,840
So what PRINCE2 says,
you have to have a way

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,330
to gather requirements, they
don't tell you what form

31
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,330
that has to take.

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,770
And so this works really
well in an Agile environment

33
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,730
because we can replace those
requirements with things like

34
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,770
epics and user stories
which then are naturally

35
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,950
an Agile way of working.

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,840
The third guidance point we have is that

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
PRINCE2 Agile is ready
for use with any project,

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,070
not just IT projects,
and this is important

39
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,320
because if you look at some
of the other frameworks,

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,330
such as Kanban, it's very
focused on manufacturing.

41
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,510
But if you look on Scrum or
you look at Lean Startup,

42
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,660
those are very focused on IT projects

43
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,490
as well as numerous other
Agile frameworks out there.

44
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,020
Because IT is one of the heavy adopters

45
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,400
of the Agile framework.

46
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,530
But we don't have to use this just for IT,

47
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,070
we can use this with any project.

48
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,090
Our fourth guidance point
is that IT only frameworks

49
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,860
and techniques are not our
focus inside of PRINCE2 Agile.

50
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,800
Instead, we're looking
at how we can use this

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,420
across all projects, like we just said,

52
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,480
in guidance point number three.

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,060
Let's move on to the fifth guidance point.

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,240
There is much more to
Agile than just Scrum.

55
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,570
In fact they like to say
that Agile is not Scrum.

56
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,337
Whilst Scrum is an Agile framework,

57
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:15,650
Agile itself does not equate to Scrum,

58
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,800
even though, in most people's minds,

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,040
they think of Scrum first

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
when you start talking about Agile.

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,030
As we mentioned before,

62
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,040
there's 10 or 12 different frameworks

63
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,470
that were mentioned in the textbook.

64
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,250
And we covered three of them in depth.

65
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,180
There is more to Agile than just Scrum.

66
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,710
When we go into guidance point number six,

67
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,283
we're going to talk about two

68
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:34,300
of our most commonly used frameworks,

69
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,420
which are Scrum and Kanban.

70
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,170
Both of those are very common and used

71
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,790
in a approach for Agile,
but they are not suitable

72
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,570
by themself for managing a
product across its life cycle.

73
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,290
And that's why we take the
techniques from Scrum and Kanban

74
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,730
and we put them into our
PRINCE2 Agile projects

75
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,500
because those techniques are great

76
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,550
but they don't give you the ability

77
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,033
to fully control it across its life cycle.

78
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,690
Now, number seven, is that
Agile is a family of behaviors,

79
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,890
concepts, frameworks and techniques.

80
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,490
And we talked about this
a lot in the last lesson.

81
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,620
We have these behaviors

82
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,720
which are our core guiding
principles and values,

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,080
we have the concepts, which
are the ways of working,

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,480
we have the frameworks which
are setup to help us working

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,365
in an Agile environment, and
techniques like burn charts

86
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,350
and sprints and timeboxing
and things like that.

87
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,150
Our final guidance point is that

88
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,870
when you're using Agile on a project,

89
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,470
you have to question how
much Agile should be used.

90
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,060
Really it comes down to not whether or not

91
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,910
I should use Agile, it's
how much of this project

92
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,880
will be done in an Agile manner.

93
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,860
So, if I'm using an example
of building a house,

94
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,750
this is something that it's
much more of a traditional

95
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,470
project management scope.

96
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,010
But we can use Agile
even in doing something

97
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,410
like building a house.

98
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,390
We my leave it up to our
electricians tp figure out

99
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,930
how they're going to wire the house

100
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,060
specifically as the wires
go through the walls.

101
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,260
But we want to tell them

102
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,430
where we want the outlets to be placed.

103
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,860
And so we can start saying how
much control is given to them

104
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,420
and how much is retained by the customer,

105
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,030
and this is part of this
Agile way of working.

106
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,250
So, again, number eight, we want
to figure out how much Agile

107
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,010
should be used in a project.

108
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,020
Now, the real benefit
here, when we start talking

109
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,013
about PRINCE2 Agile is that using Agile

110
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:15,150
doesn't mean that we're removing

111
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,090
our control or our guidance.

112
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,170
The control and governance that we have,

113
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,760
is going to allow Agile to be
used in complex environments.

114
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,620
So, no matter how complex
the thing is, for example,

115
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,750
here on the screen you will
see an F-22 fighter jet.

116
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,090
This is a hugely complex
machine but it doesn't give up

117
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,670
its control and governance,
the pilot still has the ability

118
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,810
to control and make
corrections as it goes,

119
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,450
but the plane has the
ability to self-correct it

120
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,650
as it moves through the air.

121
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,100
And so, this is one of those things

122
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,600
where we have this give and take.

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,690
When we start dealing with Agile projects,

124
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,130
we really have to think about
what control is going to be

125
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,766
held up high and what
tolerances we're going to give

126
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:56,020
so that the team, who's
delivering the final product,

127
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,750
has the wiggle room and the manouvre space

128
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,210
to really be able to
work through the issues

129
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,270
they come across inside the project.

130
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,250
Because if you don't give
them enough tolerance

131
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,100
and enough ability for them
with the left and right bounds,

132
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,760
to solve the problems themselves,

133
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,960
then you're not working in an Agile way.

134
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,330
But, giving them those tolerances,
means you have maintained

135
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,820
your control and
governance over the project

136
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,890
and so we're not giving
it up when we work Agile,

137
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,160
we're just making sure
we have defined it well

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,850
and so we can empower our teams

139
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,420
to do the right things for us,

140
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,313
as we move through these projects.
